Introduction You hear popular love songs. You see romantic movies about people who quickly fall in love. You see people in love in their everyday life. You know people who are dating. You know people who have just gotten married. Maybe you know older people who have been married for a long time. They are still in love. They talk about how having someone to love and share their life with makes them happy. However, people who are single may think it is difficult to find someone to love. We may think we are not beautiful enough for someone to love us. We may think we are not interesting enough or rich enough. We may read magazines and see pictures of rich, beautiful, and famous people. However, these people often have problems with their love lives! Being successful in love has nothing to do with being rich or beautiful. It has a lot to do with being the best person you can. You need to be open to meeting new people. You need to enjoy getting to know new people. You need to have confidence in yourself to make the first move. Now, stop and think for a moment about your love life. Do you want to find someone to share your life with? Are you ready to find someone to love? Let’s look at ten ways that you can do this: 1. Let go of failed relationships Think about your closet filled with clothes. Some of your clothes are too old to wear anymore. Some of your clothes are too big or too small. Some of your clothes are no longer in style. If you have a closet like this, you cannot buy any new clothes. You do not have any space to put them. So, why do you keep these clothes you don’t need anymore? Your love life is the same as this closet. We cannot let new love into our lives if we still think about our old relationships. We cannot trust new people if we still remember times in our life when we were rejected. Stop using the internet to see what your past loves are doing. Throw away things that remind you of past relationships. Or, put them away in a box. Write a letter to your past loves. Say good-bye to them. Then, throw the letter in the garbage can. From now on, you can focus on your future. You can find a new love. 2. Work on your outside We do not have to be beautiful to find love. We do not need the perfect body or expensive clothes. However, if we want to find love we must work on our outside. We show the world the best we can look. Get a good haircut that is easy to style. Take care of your skin. Be clean. Take good care of your fingernails and teeth. Wear clothes that make you look good and feel good. A good hairstylist or salesperson in a clothing store can help you decide what looks best on you. After taking care of yourself, take a good look at your room. Is it clean? Is it full of things that show what you are like? Do you really like the things in your room? Clean up your room. Throw, sell, or give away things you no longer enjoy. Buy a few things you like to decorate your room. Make it feel new. After you have done this, you will feel better about yourself and your life. You will be happy about your outside. Now, you will be ready to move onto the next step and work on your inside. 3. Work on your inside You have changed your outside. Now, it is time to think about your personality and talents. Follow these three steps to work on your inside: Step one: We all have things we don’t like about ourselves. But, for now, focus on the good. Write a list of things you like about yourself. What are your ten best qualities? After you finish, read the list. It will be easier for you to believe that someone can love you. Step two: Write a new list. This time write a list of things you don’t like about yourself. After you finish, read your list. Understand that many others will have the same things on their lists. Everyone has things they don’t like about themselves. But, it is important for you to focus on the things you like. Remember, nobody is perfect. Step three: Write a final list. Write about what interests you. Write about what you like to do. Write about the goals you have in your life. People like other people who have interesting things to talk about. They like people who are working toward a goal. There is an old saying, “You can’t love anyone else if you don’t love yourself.” So, work on your inside. It will then be easier to love who you are and to find someone to love. 4. Be more confident in who you are You now look your best. You have also thought about your best qualities, interests, and life goals. You feel a lot more confident now, don’t you? This is great news because people are attracted to confident people. A confident person is someone who feels good about themselves. They want to be the best person they can be instead of wishing they were someone else. They are cool and calm. They don’t get angry or sad easily and can get along with other people. They believe they do a good job. They are happy and have positive thoughts. Confidence in yourself is a skill that takes time to master. But, if you try to work on it, you can change your life for the better. Why are people more attracted to confident people? It’s because they are easier to talk to. They are more fun to be around. Confident people make us feel better when we are with them. So, people want to get to know confident people. They want to date them. If you have confidence, you will have more chance to meet others. You can connect with someone you want to date. And, this may help you to be more successful in love. 5. Don’t expect to always be successful There are many love songs about people who fall in love with someone. But, they have their heart broken. They feel like they will never find love again. Just like in a love song, you can’t always expect to be successful in love. Love is like a baseball game. A famous baseball player steps up to the home plate to hit the ball. But, they usually only get a hit about 1/3 of the time. They fail to hit the ball most of the time. Yet, everyone thinks they are successful! When baseball players strike out, they just try again the next time they are at bat. You can’t be successful in love if you don’t make the first move. So, you first need to try to talk to someone. Making the first move can feel scary. However, it is easier if you don’t feel that you have to succeed. Expect that sometimes you will be rejected by someone you like. Expect that sometimes a date won’t go well. Expect that you will strike out. Instead, focus on trying to have fun meeting new people. Have fun getting to know them. 6. Use friendly and open body language When you talk to people, the words you say are very important. But, your body language is very important, too. Body language means the way you stand or sit. It means the way you look at things or people with your eyes. Also, it is how you move your face to communicate a message. Use body language that is friendly and open. Smile at the person you are talking to and lean in. This shows that you are really interested in what they have to say. Sit with your body facing them. This shows you are only listening to them. And, make eye contact. This means you look into their eyes instead of looking at the floor or around the room. Don’t use body language that shows you don’t want to talk to somebody. For example, don’t cross your arms in front of your body. Don’t look around the room instead of into somebody’s eyes. Don’t check your cell phone while you are talking to somebody. This shows that you aren’t interested in what they have to say. 7. Focus on getting to know the other person A man was in a restaurant on a first date. He talked a lot about himself. He talked about his successes. He tried to show that he knew about many different topics. He was trying to impress his date. But, she was very bored. She wasn’t having fun. On a date, don’t try to impress the other person. Try to get to know them better. Ask them questions about their hobbies. Ask them questions about their jobs. Ask them questions about their pets. This way you can find out things you have in common. If you have things in common with the other person, it is easier to talk to them. Asking the other person questions also means you might find out something very interesting or surprising about them. People like to talk about themselves. They like to talk about what they think about the world. However, they like it even better if somebody is listening to them. They like it when somebody is interested in what they are saying. So, make sure you listen and not do all of the talking! 8. Give your relationship time and space to grow You’ve met someone and you really like them. You think you are falling in love. However, many new relationships fail. This is because the people in them try to get too close too quickly. In the movies, people fall in love quickly. They decide quickly that they want to spend the rest of their lives together. But, remember that real life is not a movie! Take time to get to know the other person. At first, a relationship is exciting and new. Therefore, our feelings can get in the way of seeing the truth about a person. This is especially important if you met the person online. When you talk online, it is easy to show your best side only. As time goes by, you will learn both the good and the bad things about your new love. You may decide that you can like both the good and bad. And, your relationship will be deeper for it. Or, you may decide that this person is not right for you. You may end the relationship. A relationship also needs space to grow. When you fall in love, you may feel like you want to spend all your free time with the other person. However, both you and your new love need time to be alone. You need time to be with your family or friends. Remember, it is a nice feeling to miss one another when you are not together. 9. Make sure the relationship is good for you What is a good relationship? When you are in a good relationship, you feel great most of the time. You feel like you can be yourself. You feel better than if you were alone. You can imagine being with this person for a long time. Maybe, you can imagine being with them forever. However, you may feel unhappy in your relationship. This can mean that this person is not right for you. There are other signs that this person may be wrong for you. For example, the person stops you seeing your friends or family. Or, the person stops you achieving your life’s goals and dreams. In every relationship, there are times when you fight or don’t get along. There are times when you have problems. These problems make being in the relationship difficult. In good relationships, these problems don’t last a long time. You help each other and soon you feel happy again. In bad relationships, the problems get bigger. And, you just feel worse and worse. It can be difficult to let go of a relationship that isn’t working well. We might be afraid of being alone. We might feel that we may never find anyone to love again. But, always remember, you found love once. You will find it again. 10. Keep things exciting Your relationship is going very well. You are in love. You may think that is all you need to do. You may think you can sit back and not have to try so hard. That’s just not true. When love is new, it is easy to be in a relationship. As time goes by, it is important to keep things exciting. When you live a busy life, it is easy to forget to spend time enjoying new things together. You may always do the same things with the person you love. It might feel comfortable. But, your relationship may soon become boring. Instead, try cooking new foods together. Go to new restaurants. Listen to new music. Take time to do new things. And, remember to compliment your partner on how they look. Compliment them on the things they do. Do things for your partner to show them they are special. Let them know they are as special as when you first fell in love with them. All of these will help keep your relationship fun and exciting for many years into the future. Summary Now that you have read the book, stop and think again.

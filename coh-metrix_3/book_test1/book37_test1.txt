2012 The phone Daniel West always went to Harry’s Diner right after work. But that particular evening, when he made his way to his usual table, he found a cell phone. Small, black, and expensive-looking, it was just lying there. As if it was waiting for him. Daniel sat down and picked it up. He looked around, to see if anyone was nearby. There was no one. Maybe the owner had gone to the bathroom. But nobody came. “I’ll be right over, Daniel,” the waitress called over to him. The phone felt good in Daniel’s hand. He pressed a button and the screen lit up, displaying all the phone’s functions. He was impressed. It could do a lot more than his old phone. The waitress was coming over. Daniel quickly hid the phone in his pocket. “What can I get you today, Daniel?” the waitress asked. “Burger and fries,” Daniel ordered. “And a coffee.” “Burger, fries, and a coffee coming right up.” The waitress turned away, but Daniel stopped her. “Have you been busy in here this afternoon?” he asked. The waitress looked surprised. “Not especially, Daniel, no,” she said and smiled. “Say, I hear you just got engaged to Emma Forrester. When’s the happy day going to be?” But Daniel didn’t want to have a conversation. “We haven’t decided on a date yet,” he said coldly, turning away. “Oh well, good luck anyway,” said the waitress, and left to give his order to the chef. Daniel decided to keep the phone and put it in his pocket. When his meal arrived, he ate it quickly. He wanted to get out of the diner as soon as he could in case the phone’s owner returned to look for it. But Emma upset that plan. She came in just as he was finishing. “Hi, baby,” she said, giving him a big smile. “I thought I’d join you this evening. We need to talk about our engagement dinner.” Emma had quite a pretty face. Once that had been enough for him. He wasn’t sure it was any longer. Just lately he had been feeling a bit bored. “I was just leaving,” Daniel said, putting his knife and fork down on the plate. Emma’s face took on the tight, hurt expression Daniel was very familiar with. “There’s no particular hurry, is there?” Emma said. “We could both have some cake.” And just like that, she put up her arm to attrwaitress’s attention. Daniel put his hand in his pocket to feel the phone. It felt smooth and exciting under his fingers. As if it came from a different world, a world where people lived exciting lives and had adventures. As he ate a piece of cake he didn’t want, Daniel didn’t take much part in the discussion about the engagement dinner. He just agreed to almost everything Emma suggested. When they finally left, he wasn’t even a hundred percent sure what he had agreed to. He didn’t care either. He just wanted to get home so he could play with the phone. So he gave Emma a kiss and said, “Got to go; I’ve got some work to do.” Emma made a disappointed face. “Want me to have a word with Dad? He shouldn’t make you work so hard!” “No!” Daniel said quickly. “It’s nothing he’s asked me to do; just a little extra I want to do. I thought he might be impressed.” Emma’s face cleared. She smiled delightedly and leaned forward to kiss him. “Oh, Daniel, that is so sweet!” Daniel just smiled and said nothing. Back in his apartment, Daniel had a good look at what the phone could do. It wasn’t long before he discovered the image gallery and the photos of a girl. An extremely beautiful girl. Daniel stared and stared at the photos, drinking in the girl’s long, black hair and dark brown eyes. Most of the photos were just of her face, but there was one of her standing in front of an old wooden building. It looked like a boathouse or something. In the photo she was wearing a dress, and she had very long legs. Daniel tried to imagine Emma dressed like that but he couldn’t. This girl must be a model. She was just perfect. Who was she? He’d never seen her around town before, and Dillonville was quite a small place. He’d definitely have noticed her. Was the phone hers? If it was, then he wanted to meet her! He was just going to check the phone’s address book to see if there was anything to show him who the phone belonged to, when there was a knock on the door and Emma walked straight in. There was no time to hide the phone. Emma was talking. “I just came to tell you I spoke to Dad about your extra work. He was so . . .” She broke off as she caught sight of the phone. “What’s that?” she said and came right over and took it from him. The photos of the beautiful girl were still on display. Emma’s smile disappeared. “Who is this?” she demanded. “And where did you get this phone?” “I don’t know who it is,” Daniel said, taking the phone back and switching it off. “I bought the phone secondhand. It’s nice though, isn’t it? I thought it would give me the right image. You know, now I’m International Sales Manager.” He was speaking quickly and sounding guilty, and Emma wasn’t happy with his statement. “Why didn’t they delete the photos if they were selling the phone?” she asked. “I don’t know,” Daniel said. “I guess they forgot. Does it matter?” “Well, of course it does!” Emma said angrily. “You’d better delete them right away.” And she sat there waiting for him to do it. It hurt to delete the photos. After he’d finished Emma was smiling at him with that satisfied smile she always had when she got her way over something. The girl in the photos still filled his brain, though. It was as if the image of her were burned there. And when Emma smiled and said, “That’s better,” Daniel smiled too, thinking Ha! You won’t get rid of her that easily! The phone rang in the early hours of the morning. Daniel had been fast asleep, but he woke up immediately. The phone was on the pillow next to him. He answered it. “Hello?” “You found my phone.” The woman speaking had a beautiful voice. Daniel felt a shiver run right down his back. “Are . . . are you the girl in the photos?” he asked, although he already knew the answer. “Yes,” she said. “I was visiting some relatives in Dillonville today. Don’t tell me; I left my phone in the diner, didn’t I?” “Yes,” Daniel said. “I was going to hand it in tomorrow. I just thought I’d wait a little while, you know; see if anyone claimed it . . .” It was a lie, and it sounded like a lie. But the girl on the other end of the line seemed to accept it. “Oh, I’m so glad you did! There aren’t too many honest people around these days.” “You’re welcome.” Daniel’s mind was working quickly, trying to think of a good place to meet so he could return the phone to her. Somewhere nice where they could talk a little, get to know each other better . . . “And who is it I have to thank?” the girl was asking. “My name’s Kathy.” Kathy. “I’m Daniel. Daniel West.” “Well, Daniel West,” the girl started to say, but then suddenly her voice changed. “Look,” she said. “I’ve got to go. I’ll call you again, OK? Bye.” “Hello? Hello?” Daniel couldn’t believe she had gone. At work the next day, Daniel couldn’t concentrate. Forrester Machinery, Emma’s father’s company, manufactured and sold high-tech farm machinery, and Daniel’s new job was to expand sales into the international market. It was an important job, and one that Daniel had, until recently, been very excited about. It was a role that would require him to travel overseas, and it paid him a very good salary. But that morning, Daniel just couldn’t get interested in anything but the girl on the phone. Alone in his office, he kept taking the phone out of his pocket, willing it to ring. But it was the phone on his desk that rang. “Daniel?” It was his boss, Tom Forrester, Emma’s father. “How are you getting on with the plans for the sales meeting? Got much interest yet?” “Yes, sir,” lied Daniel. He’d actually intended to make some important calls about the sales meeting that morning, but he’d completely forgotten. “Great. Could you make me a list of the companies who have signed up so far and bring it up to me?” “Sure,” said Daniel, doing his best to keep the worry from his voice. “Right away.” At the moment, the list would be very short. So far only one company had agreed to attend. He really had to make those phone calls. But just then his other phone began to ring. The cell phone. Kathy! He took hold of the cell phone quickly, desperate to answer it before it stopped ringing. “Hello?” he said breathlessly. Kathy laughed. “Have you been running?” she asked. Daniel’s heart missed a beat at the sound of her voice. “No,” he said. “I’m just at work.” “Oh,” said Kathy. “Well I’d better not trouble you at work. I’ll call another time.” “No!” said Daniel quickly. “No, really, it’s OK. I wasn’t doing anything important.” Kathy sounded as if she were smiling. “Well, I’m sure that’s not true. A man’s work is always important. I bet you have a really powerful job, don’t you?” “Well . . .” Daniel started to say. “There, I knew it!” Kathy said. “The first time I heard your voice I knew you had to be someone important! I’m lucky it was a guy like you who found my phone!” Daniel drew a little picture of a happy face on the paper in front of him. He was smiling. “Is that what you thought?” he said. “It sure is!” Kathy said. “So if we could just arrange how I’m going to get my phone back, then you can get on with all the important decision-making I’m sure you have to do this morning.” Important decisions? He couldn’t think of any. Except for how he was going to arrange to meet this woman. Because he just had to meet her—and soon. “I can meet you after work if you want,” he offered. “Well,” said Kathy, “that’s very kind of you. But I’m home now. In Blake’s Hollow. It’s a little place about twenty miles from Dillonville. I won’t be able to get back into town until next week.” Next week! He didn’t want to wait that long. “I can bring your phone over to you if you like,” he offered casually. “I have to travel quite a lot with my job.” “Oh,” said Kathy. “Well, if you’re sure it wouldn’t be too much trouble?” “No trouble at all.” “Well, that would be great then, thanks!” Kathy said. “When do you want to come?” Daniel thought quickly. “How about this Friday?” he said, just as the office door opened and his boss walked in. “Friday would be perfect,” Kathy said. “My husband’s out of town that day.” Her husband? She’s married? Daniel felt disappointed. But before he could say anything about it, Kathy was speaking again. “Listen,” she said. “I’ve got to go. Hayden’s back. I’ll call you again soon to arrange everything, OK?” And she went. Hayden. He had to be her husband. Kathy had sounded a little afraid of him. Why? “Daniel?” said Tom Forrester, sitting down on the edge of Daniel’s desk. “I just came down for that list.” The phone calls! He still hadn’t done them yet, and with Tom standing there, he wouldn’t be able to. “I’ve just got to add some names to it, sir,” he said. “I’ll bring it right up to your office.” “It’s no problem, son,” Tom said. “I don’t mind waiting.” Daniel sat down at his computer. He would just have to invent some interest in the sales conferences. “Just two or three more names to add,” he said, and he proceeded to type in the names of the companies who had yet to confirm that they would be attending. Tom looked at the list when Daniel gave it to him. “This is great work, son,” he said. “I never imagined we’d get Wunstein Agricultural on board. I’ve tried them myself loads of times and never got anywhere. Well done! I’m very impressed.” Tom left, carrying the list, leaving Daniel staring anxiously at the door. If he didn’t manage to get Wunstein Agricultural and all the other companies he’d just added to the list to attend the sales meeting, he could probably kiss goodbye to his job. He’d better get on the phone and persuade them as quickly as he could. But as serious as the situation was, Daniel still found it hard to focus. He kept on thinking about the sound of Kathy’s voice. He wanted to hear it again. Without giving himself time to think, Daniel pressed the button to return her call. But it wasn’t Kathy who answered; it was a man. “Yes?” he said. Daniel knew it must be Hayden, Kathy’s husband, so he didn’t speak. “Who is this?” Hayden asked. Daniel hung up. Hayden had sounded angry. The phone call had been a mistake. Maybe he had caused trouble for Kathy by calling. It was a relief when the cell phone rang again later that afternoon. Daniel had spent the last few hours on the phone trying to persuade people to come to the meeting. So far he’d had no luck. “Daniel?” “Kathy!” Daniel said, relieved. “Are you OK? I hope I didn’t get you in trouble by calling you?” “No, that’s OK,” Kathy said quickly. Too quickly. “Are you sure?” Daniel said, and Kathy sighed. “Listen, I haven’t told Hayden—that’s my husband—about meeting you, OK?” She sounded upset. “He’s a little . . . well, let’s just say he’s the jealous type.” “Kathy,” Daniel said. “He doesn’t hurt you, does he?” “Of course not!” said Kathy, but then she sighed, and when she started to speak again, Daniel could hear the tears in her voice. “Well, there was that one time . . . But then I’d done something so stupid, Daniel; he had every right to be angry with me.” Daniel’s desk phone began to ring. He knew he ought to answer it. It could be someone from Wunstein Agricultural or one of the other companies calling about the sales meeting. He let it ring. And he was glad he had, because suddenly Kathy started speaking in a rush. “I’ve tried to leave him before,” she said. She sounded as if she were crying. “I need to leave him, Daniel. He’s . . . he’s not good for me. But somehow I always end up going back. I guess I’m not a very strong person. I don’t think I can do it on my own. I need a friend to help me.” “I can be your friend, Kathy,” Daniel said right away. And just like that, he found himself promising to meet Kathy on Friday to help her escape from her husband. “You can stay with me,” he told her. “I’ve got plenty of room in my apartment.” “Oh, Daniel, that sounds fantastic! I’d be so thankful!” It was madness of course. His apartment belonged to a friend of Mr. Forrester. He rented it at a low price for that reason. He would never be able to explain Kathy being there to either his boss or Emma. If he went through with it, then he would lose both Emma and his job. But with his failure to get Wunstein Agricultural and the other companies for the sales meeting, then maybe he’d already lost his job anyway. By Friday afternoon, Daniel’s head was swimming. He stood and looked around his office. This might be the last time he worked in it! It was crazy how quickly things could change. This job had been so important to him just a short while ago. Now he was thinking about risking it all. And he hadn’t even met Kathy! The phone rang. He let it go to answerphone. “Hi, Daniel, it’s Emma. Just wanted to say I love you! See you later.” Should he forget all about Kathy? This was a good job. And Emma was a sweet enough girl. He’d been in love with her once. Daniel closed his eyes, trying to think what to do. A woman’s face filled his mind. Not Emma’s face, but Kathy’s. Her long, black hair. Her sweet red mouth. The cell phone made a noise. It was a message from Kathy. See you later by the boathouse. There was an attachment. It was a photo of Kathy. She was smiling out at him and she was wearing a red dress that made her look fantastic. With a woman like Kathy by his side, he could do anything. He could live an exciting life. A life of adventure. He knew he could make Kathy like him. If he rescued her and took care of her, she’d be very thankful to him. She’d said so, hadn’t she? His mind made up, Daniel went toward the door. It was very dark in the thick trees near the lake. Kathy had suggested that he park his car a short distance away and walk down to the boathouse this way, but it was difficult to walk quietly. There were dead branches everywhere. He shouldn’t need to walk quietly; Kathy had said Hayden would be out for several hours. But Daniel felt nervous anyway. He didn’t like the dark shadows in the wood. He wasn’t a country boy, and he had a distinct feeling he was being watched. Daniel was almost at the edge of the trees when the phone began to ring. He took it from his pocket quickly, thinking it might be Kathy, but the caller display showed that it was Emma. She was probably calling to see where he was. He wished now that he hadn’t given her the number, but she had insisted on having it. Daniel pressed a button to end the call and walked on. A few moments later, the phone began to ring again. Suddenly there was a sound somewhere behind him, the sound of a branch breaking. Was someone else in the woods with him? Had Hayden returned early? Emma’s calls were going to give him away! Hurriedly Daniel switched off the phone and waited, breathing quickly and trying not to panic. He couldn’t hear anything now. Perhaps it had been an animal or something. Feeling slightly sick, Daniel wiped his face with his arm. Then he closed his eyes, willing himself to calm down. He saw Emma in his mind. The way she’d looked so proud of him when he’d lied about doing extra work for her father. He could switch on his phone now. He could call her. There was still time. I’m sorry, honey, I’m just on my way home! He could be the type of man who did extra work without being asked to. He could marry Emma and be safe. But then he would always wonder about the beautiful Kathy and what his life might have been like if he’d made a different choice. Oh, Daniel; I’d be so thankful! There were no more sounds behind him. Daniel made his decision and walked out of the trees. He could see the boathouse about fifty meters away. Then suddenly, as he watched, there was a movement up ahead. Somebody dressed in red was running past the boathouse to what looked like a jetty going down into the water. Was it Kathy? It had to be Kathy! Leaving the cover of the trees, Daniel ran after her, not daring to call out in case Hayden was around. But then he heard the sound of a woman screaming. The scream was quickly followed by a loud splash. Now he did call out. “Kathy!” There was the sound of more running footsteps, then nothing. Then he heard a faint voice, calling to him. “Daniel! Help me!” It sounded like it was coming from the lake. “Kathy!” he called. He was running now, past the old boathouse and onto the jetty, his footsteps loud on the wooden boards. He saw that some of the boards were of a lighter wood and realized that they must have been replaced. Was the jetty safe? But then he thought about the photo Kathy had sent him earlier of her at this very place; her beautiful figure and her lovely smile. He decided to risk it. “Kathy!” he shouted again. “Where are you?” There was no answer, no sound at all except for the gentle movement of the water. When he reached the end of the jetty, Daniel stood looking wildly about him, feeling as if he were going out of his mind. Kathy must be here somewhere; he had heard her! Then he remembered the splash and looked down into the water. It was just starting to get dark and he couldn’t see too clearly, but he could see something red below the surface, a little way out in the lake. Kathy had been wearing a red dress! Oh God, had Hayden pushed her in? Was she drowning? Not stopping to think further, Daniel quickly took off his jacket and kicked off his shoes. Then he jumped in. The water was icy as it closed over his head. It was dark too; his movements were disturbing the mud on the lake bottom. For a moment he lost sight of the red shape. He surfaced to grab some air, then went straight back under again. There! There it was! Quickly he swam the ten meters or so toward it, stretching his hand out. He made contthe material. Only . . . it wasn’t material at all; it was plastic. This wasn’t Kathy; it was an old piece of garbage. Daniel let go and started to make for the surface. Except that he couldn’t. His arms and his legs were moving— quickly and with an increasing sense of panic—but he was hardly making any progress at all. There was a really strong current coming from somewhere, and the water was pulling at him. It was as if some huge hand was holding onto him, trying to prevent him from pushing up to the surface. Daniel’s chest burned with the need to breathe. Terrified, he used every last bit of his strength to push upward. And finally, finally he managed to make it to the surface. Quickly, he took a big breath. The current was trying to pull him down again. He knew that if it did, he would drown, and desperately he searched round for something, anything to hold onto. And that’s when he saw Kathy, standing on the jetty, watching him. She was standing close to a man. The man had his arm around her. They were both smiling. “Kathy?” said Daniel, confused, but the water was taking him again, and his voice made no sound as he slid back beneath the dark surface. And as Daniel finally gave in and let the water into his nose and his mouth, the piece of red plastic floated away on the current. 1950 Just a little more “Welcome to Seattle, Marcia!” Two weeks ago Marcia Wallis had won a modeling competition in her hometown. Now she was here, in Seattle, in the office of Joan Haynes, of Haynes’ International Modeling Agency, about to start her new career. “How are you settling into your new apartment?” Joan Haynes asked her now. It was the first time Marcia had met her. “The room will be fine until I can find something more suitable,” Marcia said, thinking with dislike of the small, dark room surrounded by lots of other small, dark rooms. Even though she was on the sixth floor, the sounds from the street were really loud. It was smelly and dirty, and girls were always coming and going from each other’s rooms, talking and laughing. “Don’t you like it?” Joan asked, sounding surprised. “New models usually appreciate being with everybody else when they first come to the city. It helps them to make friends.” She looked at Marcia over the little glasses she used for reading. “Marcia,” Joan went on, “you’ve done really well to get this opportunity, but I have to tell you, it will be a while before you’re earning very much money. I’ll show your photographs around of course, but you’ll still have to become known. The rooms at the Redman might not be perfect, but they are very cheap.” Marcia smiled. “I’m sure Daddy will help out,” she told her employer confidently. She was certain about it. True, her father said that modeling was just a cheap way to make a living and that he was embarrassed to have a model as a daughter. But that didn’t mean anything. Marcia knew that within two days he’d be missing her so much he’d be in Seattle with his checkbook. Daddy wouldn’t keep a dog in the Redman Building. “I see,” said Joan, looking at her thoughtfully. “Well, I’ll be in touch when I’ve got some work for you.” Marcia filled the rest of the day with sightseeing and shopping. By the time she got back to the Redman Building, she was exhausted. The thought of having to make something for herself to eat in the tiny kitchen was depressing. She’d hardly cooked anything in her life; her family had a cook to do that. She ought to have eaten out. As she was putting her key in the lock, somebody called out to her. “Hello, there . . . Sorry, I don’t know your name.” It was her neighbor, a tall girl with short curly blonde hair. She was wearing trousers and bright red lipstick. Marcia viewed the trousers critically. She couldn’t understand why anybody would want to dress like a man when there were so many pretty dresses to buy in the shops. Marcia gave a little cough before answering. “I’m Marcia,” she said. “Dora,” the girl smiled, holding out her hand. Marcia put her bags down on the floor and shook the girl’s hand. “Say, I’m having a little party tonight,” Dora said. “You’re welcome to come. It’s my birthday.” “A party?” Marcia repeated. “In your room?” Dora laughed. “No! It wouldn’t be much of a party in there, would it? No, it’s down at Brownie’s Bar on the next block. You’re very welcome. Eight o’clock.” Dora looked at her watch. “Speaking of which, I’d better go. Need to start putting my make-up on and getting ready. See you later!” And she went back into her room. Marcia didn’t go to the party. She didn’t want to socialize with Dora and her friends. Besides, she’d seen Brownie’s Bar; it looked like an awful place. But she did get woken up later that night when Dora brought several friends back to her room. Marcia knocked hard on the wall. “Some people are trying to sleep!” she called out. There was a brief silence, and then more laughter, louder, if anything. First thing next morning Marcia rang home to give her parents her address. After all, her father would need to know where to come with his checkbook! “Oh, Marcia! It’s you.” Her mother was whispering. Marcia was confused. “Why are you talking that way?” she asked. “It’s your father,” her mother said. “He says I shouldn’t talk to you. None of us should. Not until you forget about modeling and come back home.” “He ought to be proud of my success!” Marcia declared. Her mother sighed. “I’m afraid that’s not the way he sees it, dear,” she said. Marcia left her address anyway, but she felt let down and slightly worried, too. Maybe she shouldn’t have spent all that money on dresses yesterday? Then she shook her head. No, her father would come round. He always did. She felt a little better when she finally got her first modeling job. It was for a fashion catalog, which, while it wasn’t quite as exciting as modeling on a runway, was a good start. Marcia put on her prettiest dress and turned up at the address she had been given. When she got there, she found about half the girls who lived at the Redman Building already there. Dora was among them. Marcia hadn’t seen Dora since she’d complained about the noise in the middle of the night, and she wasn’t surprised when Dora didn’t talk to her. None of the other girls did either. There was another girl Marcia hadn’t met before there too—a slim girl with long black hair, dressed in a red dress. Marcia approved of the dress, even though it was slightly more suitable for eveningwear than for daywear. Like her, the black-haired girl sat quietly waiting, not joining in the excited talk of the other girls. When at last somebody called them through into a changing room and asked them to get changed, Marcia hated the clothes they were expected to wear. They were all designed for outdoor activities, in sensible materials and boring greens and browns. The styles and colors didn’t suit her at all. None of the other girls seemed to mind. They were all talking happily to each other as they put the horrible clothes on. Marcia looked around for the girl in the red dress to see if she felt the same way she did, but the girl didn’t seem to be there any longer. She must have left. One by one, the other girls were called to stand in front of the camera to have their photographs taken. They smiled cheerfully over and over again. They took jackets off and put them back on. Marcia got bored watching them. Then finally the man in charge came over to Marcia. “Sorry,” he said. “I just don’t feel you have the right look for this collection. We won’t be using you after all.” “Well, honestly!” Marcia complained. “After keeping me waiting all this time!” Feeling angry and foolish, she changed quickly before the others finished. Then she left. Just outside the exit, she saw the girl in the red dress. “Didn’t they want you either?” she asked. The girl smiled at her. “I didn’t want them!” she said. “The clothes were really awful, weren’t they?” Marcia felt a rush of relief. She smiled. “Oh, I’m so glad to find someone who agrees with me!” she said. “Come on,” the girl said. “Let’s go and get a coffee. My name’s Kathy Murray, by the way.” And without waiting for Marcia to answer, she took Marcia’s arm and drew her across the street toward a cheerful-looking coffee shop. It was good to talk to somebody. Marcia realized she’d been a little lonely since she’d arrived in Seattle. Kathy was an interesting person. Marcia learned that she worked for a different modeling agency and she was married. “So last year I left my husband to look after things at home and came to Seattle,” she told Marcia. “Didn’t he mind?” Marcia asked. “Well, of course he misses me like crazy.” Kathy smiled. “But he knows how much success means to me. I’ll just do this for a few years, earn as much money as I can, and then I’ll go home and have babies.” “And are you earning a lot of money?” Marcia asked. “Sure,” said Kathy. “I get so many offers of work; I have to turn some down.” Marcia looked at her new friend. She was pretty all right, but not that pretty. “What’s your secret?” she asked. Kathy leaned forward across the table. “When I came here I missed out on lots of work. Everybody just thought I was too big. As soon as I lost weight, the offers came rolling in. You should try it.” Marcia sat back, feeling wounded. “Excuse me!” she said. “I don’t need to lose weight! I just won a modeling competition!” “Don’t get all cross with me,” Kathy replied calmly. “I was just telling you what worked for me, that’s all.” Marcia looked at her, suddenly feeling doubtful. “You don’t really think I need to lose weight, do you?” she asked. Kathy drank some of her coffee. “It doesn’t matter what I think, does it?” she said. “It’s what the people who book the models think.” “But, I told you; I just won a modeling competition!” Kathy put her hands up. “Hey, don’t worry about it! That’s just my opinion. You don’t have to listen to it. What do I know? Maybe I’ve just been lucky.” She changed the subject, telling Marcia about some of the modeling work she’d done overseas. It sounded so exciting that Marcia began to feel hopeful again. Things would be all right. Soon she would be turning down work the way Kathy did; she just knew it. And the very next day, Marcia did get some work, much better work than modeling stupid outdoor clothing. Along with some of the other models from the agency, Marcia was asked to model a collection of wedding dresses. They were beautiful, really beautiful. The only problem was the photographer. He just didn’t seem to know how to make the best of them. “Put your arms in the air,” he said to her. “Pretend you’re celebrating.” Marcia couldn’t do it. “A girl just wouldn’t do that on her wedding day!” she objected. Dora and the other girls didn’t seem to mind. They put their arms up in the air and laughed as if they were at some wild party, not a wedding. Marcia couldn’t understand it. She saw Dora later that day when she got home. The two girls hadn’t spoken since Marcia had complained about the noise on Dora’s birthday, but now Dora paused in the hallway. “Listen, tell me to mind my own business if you like,” she said, “but I think you ought to just try and do what the photographers ask you to do. They’re the guys who give us the work, after all.” Marcia remembered the way Dora and her friends had ignored her at the outdoor clothing event. She was angry that Dora dared to give her advice now. “Mind your own business!” she said. “Sure,” said Dora, unlocking her room. “I just thought I’d say.” Then she went in and closed the door. That night Dora had some friends back to her room again, and once again Marcia was woken up. Lying in the darkness listening to the laughter, Marcia decided to do something about it. The next morning she complained to Mr. Brown, the owner of the building. She was delighted when Mr. Brown took her complaint seriously and asked Dora to pack her bags and leave. Marcia watched her go. “I don’t have anywhere to go!” she protested to Mr. Brown. “You should have thought about that before you caused trouble,” he told her. Dora looked back at Marcia as if she hated her. “This is all your fault!” she shouted. Marcia didn’t bother to reply. She was glad Dora was going. It was her own fault. But since Dora was very popular with the other girls, nobody even pretended to be friendly to Marcia after that. Marcia told herself she didn’t care. She didn’t need a load of fools for friends! But she was glad when she ran into Kathy again though. “How are things?” Kathy asked. “Are you getting more work now?” Marcia had to admit that she still wasn’t getting very many offers. There had been one job modeling coats, but the photographer had wanted them all to look so serious. Marcia hadn’t been able to understand it. “I tried to tell him they’d sell more coats if we smiled, but he wouldn’t listen to me,” she said. Kathy laughed. “Maybe you’re just too clever to be a model, Marcia,” she said. “Or maybe . . .” “What?” asked Marcia. “Well,” said Kathy. “I don’t like to bring it up again, but have you thought about my suggestion?” “To lose weight?” Marcia asked. Kathy nodded. “You could at least try it, couldn’t you? See if it makes any difference or not?” Marcia looked across the table at Kathy. “I suppose I could,” she said. Then she laughed. “Anyway, I might have to eat less! I’m not even sure how I’m going to afford next month’s rent!” Kathy put her hand on top of Marcia’s on the table. “Don’t worry,” she said. “I won’t let you go hungry or be homeless.” Marcia felt suddenly close to tears. “Thank you,” she said. “Don’t mention it!” Kathy said. “A good friend always tries to help her friends get what they deserve in life.” So from that day on, Marcia went on a diet. It was difficult at first; she felt hungry all the time. But after a short while, it became easier. Kathy was always very encouraging every time the two girls met. “You’re looking great, Marcia!” she’d say. “Just a little more, and you’ll be the perfect weight!” And Kathy’s plan worked, at least at first. Marcia did get more work offers. Oh, they weren’t as exciting as she’d imagined they would be when she’d won the modeling competition, and the photographers continued to make stupid requests. Sometimes Marcia thought it would be better for everybody if she just went round to the other side of the camera and took the pictures herself! But now she wasn’t eating so much, she didn’t have very much energy. And because she didn’t have much energy, she couldn’t be bothered to complain any longer. She just got on with it. She often met up with Kathy in what they now thought of as “their” coffee shop. Their conversations were a high point in Marcia’s life. So she was very disappointed when Kathy told her she was going home to her husband for a few weeks. “Come over for a visit,” she invited. “Hayden would love to meet you.” “I’d love to meet him too,” Marcia said, although she wasn’t sure it was true. She just couldn’t bear the thought of being away from her friend for that length of time. She had come to depend on Kathy’s company and advice. “What about my weight?” she asked Kathy before she left. “Do you think I’ve lost enough yet?” Kathy looked at her. Her eyes were so dark they hardly seemed to reflect the light. “Just a little more, Marcia, honey,” she said. “Just a little more.” A week or so after Kathy had left for her home in Blake’s Hollow, Joan Haynes called Marcia into her office. The modeling agency was several blocks away from the Redman Building, but as Marcia had hardly worked at all lately, she walked there to save money. None of her clothes really fit her now. She would need some money to buy new ones. She was feeling excited. She hadn’t seen Joan Haynes in person very much. She’d always dealt with one of Joan’s assistants. Maybe Joan had exciting news for her. Perhaps she was going to be sent overseas for a job! If that was it, then she would go shopping right after the meeting to celebrate! By the time she arrived at the agency, Marcia was exhausted. She had to wait a few minutes to get her strength back before she approached Joan Haynes’s office. Then when she did go in, Joan’s mouth fell open with shock. “My God!” Joan said. “People told me, but I didn’t believe it! What have you done to yourself, girl?” Marcia sat down. She had to, because she was feeling so weak. She looked at Joan in confusion. “What do you mean?” she asked. “You’re so thin!” Joan said. Marcia felt pleased. Maybe she had achieved the right weight at last? It was a pity Kathy wasn’t around to see it. “Do you like it?” she asked, smiling, confident she was going to receive Joan’s approval. But to her surprise, Joan was shaking her head. “No, Marcia, I don’t,” she declared. “And neither do our clients. I’m going to have to take you off our books while you sort yourself out.” When Marcia gazed at her with shock, Joan sighed and got out of her chair. “Listen, honey,” she said, putting a kind hand on Marcia’s shoulder. “Go back home to your family. Let them take care of you. Come back to me when you’ve put a little weight back on, and we’ll see what we can do for you, OK?” Marcia left Joan’s office feeling shocked and confused. She had come here expecting to receive the news that her career was really about to take off, and instead she had lost her job. She just didn’t understand it. Maybe Kathy’s agency preferred a different look for their models? If only Kathy weren’t in Blake’s Hollow. She needed to talk to her! Walking away from the Haynes building, tears filled Marcia’s eyes. Joan Haynes had advised her to go home to her family, but there was no way she was going to do that. She hadn’t heard from them since she’d gotten to Seattle. Her father hadn’t turned up with his checkbook. He had also stopped paying money into her bank account every month the way he usually did. Her mother had written her a note. “Your father says he won’t give you any more money until you come home to us, Marcia. I do hope you’ll see sense and do as he asks.” No! Angrily, Marcia wiped the tears away from her face. There was no way she was going back home. She would feel like a loser. And anyway, her parents didn’t even feel like her family any longer! Kathy felt like her family. Kathy! She had to see her and tell her what had happened. Kathy would give her an introduction to her agency. She’d make everything all right again. Marcia traveled to Blake’s Hollow by bus. The route took her close to where her family lived. For a moment she wanted to shout to the driver to stop so she could get off the bus and carry her bag over the hill until she was home. But then she thought about how her father would expect her to be—apologetic and beaten—and she just couldn’t do it. He was wrong. Joan Haynes was wrong. She would be famous, the next top model. Kathy would help her to make it happen. When she arrived at Blake’s Hollow, she took out the piece of paper with Kathy’s address on it. 14 Quayside. Which direction should she go? Behind her were a small church and a few houses. In front of her was a group of very tall, ancient-looking trees. A path went through them, and at the end of the path, it looked as if it was lighter. Perhaps that was the lake, showing through the trees? Kathy had said she lived next to the lake. Marcia wasn’t nervous of the trees. Not at first, anyway. She was too busy thinking about finding Kathy. She needed to find Kathy. These days she only felt right when she was speaking to Kathy. Now, as she walked, she spoke to Kathy in her head. Am I going the right way? Do I need to go much further? The answer came, just as if Kathy were actually there with her. Just a little more, Marcia, just a little more . . . The trees began to thin out. The light was getting closer. Marcia felt relieved. A wind had started blowing, and some way into the woods, the sound of the cedar branches moving had begun to sound like whispering. The trees were like a dark crowd pressing in on her, watching to see what she was doing. She was so very tired too; her legs felt really heavy and weak. She realized she hadn’t had any breakfast that day. In fact, she couldn’t remember the last time she’d eaten. It didn’t matter; there would be plenty of time for eating after she’d seen Kathy. She was almost at the edge of the woods when she saw a man walking toward her. Her footsteps slowed. She suddenly felt nervous. But then he spoke to her, and his voice was comfortingly cheerful. “Hello!” he said. “Are you lost?” Marcia moved forward quickly with relief. “I’m not sure,” she said. “I’ve come to visit Kathy Murray.” She looked at her piece of paper. “At 14 Quayside?” The man was smiling. “Kathy’s my wife,” he said. “You’re Hayden?” Marcia said, looking at him. He was tall and good-looking. And he had dark, dark eyes like Kathy. “That’s right,” he nodded. “That’s me. You’re going the right way. Kathy’s waiting for you. Maybe I’ll see you when I get back?” And he gave her a wave and walked on into the trees. Marcia stood watching him go for a while, and then walked on. Hayden said that Kathy was waiting for her, which was a little odd, since she didn’t tell her she was coming. And how did Hayden know who she was anyway? But she soon forgot about all of that in her excitement to see her friend again. Suddenly there was a sign: Quayside. This must be it. But how could it be? There weren’t any houses here, just boathouses. Kathy and her husband couldn’t live in a boathouse, could they? It didn’t make sense. Number 14 was painted dark green. The paint looked old and worn, as did the building. Surely this couldn’t be the right place? And yet Hayden had told her she was going in the right direction. “Kathy?” she called, her voice sounding quiet and nervous. She lifted her hand and knocked on the old wooden door. It swung open slowly. Marcia looked inside. The boathouse was very dark and it smelled old and uncared for. No, worse than that really. It smelled as if something had died in it. Marcia stepped back quickly. Surely this couldn’t be the right place? There must be some kind of mistake. She was just about to turn back when a movement near the lake caught her eye. A woman in a red dress was just about to step off the end of the jetty into a boat. It was Kathy! Marcia shouted at the top of her voice. “Kathy!” Kathy paused to look at her, her long dark hair blowing round her face in the wind. She didn’t speak. Why didn’t she speak? “Kathy!” Marcia called again, and began running along the jetty, her feet loud on the wood. She didn’t notice how old the wooden boards were. Or that some of them were broken. Suddenly her foot went right through a hole in the jetty. There was a loud crack as the wood broke further. She was falling through! She couldn’t stop herself! “Kathy!” she screamed, but Kathy didn’t move to try to help her. She just carried on standing there at the end of the jetty, staring in her direction. “Kathy! Please! Help me!” Desperately Marcia tried to keep hold of the wood of the jetty to stop herself from slipping right through into the water. But it was so long since she’d eaten a proper meal she just didn’t have the strength to hold onto the old boards. Slowly at first, then more and more quickly, she began to fall, her body sliding through the hole into the water. “Kathy!” Marcia called one more time as the water covered her face. And the bubbles from her voice rose up to the shining surface of the water before they disappeared forever. 1928 The king of hearts “No! Don’t say it!” Daisy put her fingers over her boyfriend Tim O’Hara’s mouth to stop him speaking. There were tears pouring down her face. Tim managed to move his face just enough to say, “But, Daisy . . . ,” holding the little ring box out to her again. Daisy pushed the hand that was holding the little box away from her and picked up her coat, quickly putting it on. “No, Tim. I love you; you know that. It’s not fair to tempt me with happily ever after when you can’t offer it to me. If I said ‘yes’ to you, then I would be saying ‘yes’ to a lifetime of debt and worry. And I just can’t do that.” He couldn’t let her leave. He wanted to marry her and he was scared that if she left now, like this, he would never see her again. “It won’t be like that, Daisy,” he said desperately. “I promise you I’ll change!” He looked at her face, seeing the doubt there. “I know I’ve said that before,” he went on, “but this time I really mean it! Daisy, Marcus Spitzburg is coming to look at my paintings tomorrow; I know he’ll buy one! Please, Daisy!” Daisy had reached the door by now. “Even if he does, you’ll be right back out there risking all the money he pays you,” she told him sadly. “No. Unless you can prove to me that you’ve given up playing cards for good, then . . . then I’m afraid it’s all over between us. Goodbye, Tim.” After she’d gone, Tim lay on the floor in despair. He couldn’t believe what had just happened. He felt just as if he’d been kicked. Daisy. Tim couldn’t imagine life without her. She was so pretty and funny. He just had to look at her to feel good about life. That was when she didn’t have that disapproving look on her face, of course. And lately she’d had that look on her face a lot when she looked at him. If only he could convince her that playing poker wasn’t just a bad habit. If you were really good at it, it could be a real career choice. He knew plenty of guys who managed to make a lot of money from it, guys who were almost as rich as Marcus Spitzburg. Tim supposed he’d better get up and do some work so he had something for Spitzburg to buy. Getting to his feet, Tim went over and took one of his drawing books down from a shelf. Then he sat down and turned the pages, searching for something to paint. Spitzburg liked paintings of the famous buildings of Seattle. Tim was getting a little bored painting buildings, but Spitzburg wasn’t the only person who liked them. He had a lot of friends. And Daisy liked them. Daisy was an artist too, and she thought painting buildings was a good way to make a living. He was sure that if he showed Daisy he was really serious about being an artist, she would come back to him. She had to. By the following morning, Tim had two paintings to show Spitzburg. He’d been up all night finishing them, and now he was tired. Spitzburg was due at ten o’clock. Tim intended to sleep after that. Then he’d go and see Daisy, show her the cash he’d gotten from Spitzburg. If Spitzburg bought one of the paintings. Ten o’clock arrived. Then ten fifteen. Spitzburg was late. Tim walked up and down his apartment like a trapped animal, waiting for him. What if he didn’t show up? But he had to show up. Finally, at ten thirty-five, Tim heard a car outside. He glanced out the window and was glad to see Spitzburg’s driver holding the car door open for Spitzburg to get out. Twenty minutes later, Tim had a hundred dollars in his hand. Spitzburg had bought both paintings! Tim wanted to shout with joy. Spitzburg said he had friends who would like paintings too if Tim could do them. No more sleeping; he had to see Daisy right away. She had to be impressed about this! Tim put the money in his pocket and headed straight for Daisy’s studio. But when he arrived, Daisy wasn’t there. Disappointed, Tim hung around for a while, but when she didn’t return, he went into town. He intended just to get a coffee and something to eat somewhere before he tried Daisy’s studio again, but somehow he ended up outside the club where he played poker. He stood outside, his hand holding the bank notes in his pocket. A hundred dollars. It was a lot of money. But was it enough to persuade Daisy to come back to him? He didn’t know. Where was she, anyway? She went on at him about working on his paintings, but why wasn’t she working on hers? She was probably out shopping for a hat or something. That’s what women liked to do. Whereas men, well, men liked a good game of cards. Just one game. It couldn’t hurt, could it? Daisy would never know, and maybe he could win some more money. Two hundred dollars would be a lot more impressive than a hundred dollars. Tim went quickly down the steps and knocked on the door. Inside the club it was warm and filled with smoke. Tim smiled and took a deep breath, experiencing a light feeling inside him—the kind of feeling you get when you come home after a long time away. Several people nodded to him. He nodded back, then did a tour of the room. There were three different games going on, but it was the one being played at the back of the room that really got his attention. Because one of the players was a girl. He couldn’t remember seeing a girl playing at the club before. And what a girl she was! She had long dark hair and dark eyes, and she was wearing a red dress that showed her figure off nicely. She was beautiful. But even more beautiful than the girl was the large amount of money lying on the table in front of her. If he could win all of that, then Daisy would have to agree to come back to him! Tim stood and watched the game for a while. As far as he could see, the girl was using her money to win. She had so much of the stuff, she could afford to be brave, betting on the cards in her hand even when they weren’t necessarily good. The guys were losing badly, but they were being very good about it, because the girl was charming them with her smiles and good looks. But soon they began to admit defeat, dropping out one by one. Tim thought quickly. There was big money to be won here, he was sure of it. He had Spitzburg’s hundred dollars, but would it be enough? The girl had more than that. Thinking only of the potential winnings, Tim felt the little jewelry box inside his pocket. He could sell the ring; use the cash he got for it to play in the game. Then when he won, he could buy another ring. Daisy hadn’t opened the box, so she hadn’t seen the ring. She’d never know the difference. Hoping the girl would still be there when he got back, Tim hurried out to the nearest jewelry store to sell the ring. He’d bought it for Daisy after a particularly good win at cards a few weeks previously. It had cost a lot of money, and he was lucky to get quite a lot back for it now. Fifteen minutes later he was back at the game. The girl was sitting alone with her money. “I’m in,” he said, and took the seat opposite her, confident that now he had as much money as she did. The girl looked at him across the table and smiled. “Hi,” she said. “My name’s Kathy.” Tim put his hand out for her to shake. “Tim O’Hara,” he said. “Good to meet you,” the girl replied, her dark eyes shining across the table at him. “Shall we play?” “I’ll deal,” said Tim and picked up the cards. He gave some to the girl and some to himself. When he looked at his, he saw that they were only OK, not fantastic. “I’ll bet five dollars,” said the girl. If Tim wanted to carry on playing he had to bet more than that. He looked carefully at the girl, but her sweet, smiling face was giving him no idea of how good her cards were. Tim felt the familiar feeling of excitement in his bones. This was what he loved about poker, the unknown and the risk. If he wanted to win the girl’s money, then he was going to have to take a chance. And his cards weren’t too bad. Tim took a risk and carried on playing. But the girl had better cards than him, and he lost. They played another round. Once again, he lost. Tim moved uncomfortably in his seat. His shirt was starting to feel wet with sweat. He knew he ought to quit playing while he still had enough money to buy another ring for Daisy, but he couldn’t do it. There was still a chance he could win all his money back as well as some of the girl’s, and while there was a chance of that, he just couldn’t stop. Lots of people were watching now, but Tim’s complete concentration was on the game. It was the girl’s turn to deal, and when Tim looked at his cards, his heart jumped. He had three kings. It was a good hand; there wasn’t much that could beat it. It was time to take a really big risk. Tim counted the money he had left. Then he pushed it all into the center of the table. If the girl wanted to carry on playing, she would have to put in the same amount of money. Would she want to risk that much? She did. And as she pushed the large amount of bank notes across the table, Tim’s body filled with a familiar mix of terror and excitement. Those few seconds before he found out whether he was going to win or lose were always the same, amazing and unbearable all at once. He loved it. Very slowly, somehow keeping his hands steady despite his heart racing inside his chest, he turned his cards over to show the three kings. Then he watched as the girl turned over her cards. She had three aces. She had won again. Tim stared, feeling sick. He couldn’t believe it. He just could not believe it. The girl began to pull the huge amount of money toward her. Everything he had was there. The money from Spitzburg. The money from Daisy’s ring. He’d have to paint pictures for several months to get all of that money back. And Daisy was a pretty girl. She always had other men asking her out. What if she met someone before he was ready to go and ask her to marry him again? Oh God, he was such a fool! The woman called Kathy was talking to him. He took his hands away from his face to look at her. Her expression was one of concern. “I’m guessing that was a big loss for you, right?” she said. Tim nodded. “Well, yeah. You could say that,” he agreed. The girl took something from her bag. “Well, listen,” she said. “I won this in a game the other day. I don’t need it. You can have it if you want.” And she held a piece of paper out to him. Tim reached out to take it, trying to focus on what it said. It appeared to be the official papers for a property, a boathouse at a place called Blake’s Hollow. Tim vaguely remembered the name of the place. He thought it was quite a good area. Personally, he hated the water. He couldn’t even swim. But other people didn’t feel the same way he did. The place might be worth something. But why would the girl want him to have it instead of selling it herself? He looked up, intending to ask her, but found that she had already gone. The people around the table were beginning to move away. One man put a kind hand on Tim’s arm before he left, but that was it. Soon Tim was on his own and feeling miserable. Suddenly he missed Daisy more than ever. She was so gentle, so pretty. But he could hardly go back to her studio now, could he? Maybe he ought to get out of town for a while. He could visit this boathouse to get an idea of what it was worth. Yes. That was what he would do. With no money to pay for a bus ride, Tim had to stand at the side of the road and beg for rides to get to Blake’s Hollow. It took four rides and a lot of hours to get there. By the time he arrived, it was almost dark. There was nobody around, and the light wasn’t good enough to start searching for the boathouse. Eventually Tim saw a church with a covered area by the door. He’d spend the night there and look for the boathouse in the morning. It wouldn’t be the first time he’d slept outside. Settling down on a stone seat, Tim tried to get to sleep. But the events of the last twenty-four hours kept running through his mind like a movie, keeping him awake. He was exhausted, but the seat was hard, and by now the moon had come out. It was a big, full moon, and it was shining right down on him, making it seem almost as light as day. Getting up, Tim stretched his tired body and began to walk around the graveyard for something to do. He read the gravestones as he went. After a while, he noticed something. Practically everyone buried in the graveyard had the name Wallis, West, or O’Hara, like him. There were hardly any other names at all. Strange. Those three families must be important in these parts, he thought. Something else was strange he noticed: none had lived beyond the age of thirty. Thinking no more of it, Tim returned to the seat to try to sleep again. But the wind had come up by now, filling the graveyard with strange sounds as the branches of the trees brushed together. It was as if there was some great animal in the place, coughing and sighing. There was no way he was going to get to sleep with all that noise going on. Maybe he should go look for the boathouse now instead of waiting until morning? After all, the moon was very bright. He was unlikely to get lost. He found the boathouse in the middle of a line of boathouses. Number 14. Tim thought it was dark green, but he couldn’t be sure. The moonlight was playing tricks with the shadows. It was like being in a stolen silver world, a world people don’t usually get to experience, where colors and sounds are slightly altered from the normal. As Tim approached the door, his footsteps sounded unnaturally loud in the silence. For the first time it occurred to him that the boathouse might be locked. Because the girl had disappeared like that, he had no idea if he needed a key to get in. He hadn’t had the chance to ask her any questions. It was strange, the way she had disappeared so quickly like that. Very strange. Tim put out a hand to push at the door. It opened. Good. No need for a key then. Maybe the key was inside somewhere? “Hello?” Tim wasn’t sure why he spoke as he went inside, except that it felt as if someone was watching him. But how could that be? It was the middle of the night, and nobody had known he was coming here. He went further inside. There was a strong, unpleasant smell, like something very old. Or dead. Perhaps some animal had gotten trapped in here and died? One of the bright bands of moonlight was shining in through the window, lighting up a table. There was something lying on the old, wooden surface. Why, if it wasn’t some playing cards! Three of them, lying face up. How strange. Though perhaps it wasn’t so strange after all. After all, the girl had won the place in a poker game. Tim went closer to the table to take a look. As he did so, the hairs on the back of his neck began to stand up. He had a horrible feeling that he knew what the three cards on the table would be. He was right. They were three kings, the same cards that had lost him all his money in the game with the girl. The King of Clubs, the King of Spades, and the King of Hearts. And yet . . . wasn’t there something different about them? Tim went closer to take a look. He picked up the King of Clubs to study it. The King’s face had been altered! How strange. Instead of the usual picture, there was a picture of a dark-haired man with dark eyes, like a photograph. And surely the face on the King of Spades was . . . the girl? His heart crashing inside his chest, Tim picked up all three cards and hurried outside with them to get a better look. There in the moonlight, he stared at them. Yes, the face on the King of Spades was definitely her. The girl. Kathy. But it was the face on the King of Hearts that really made his mouth fall open with terror. For it was his own face. Except he didn’t look the way he had ever seen himself look in any mirror he had ever looked in. This was him as he would look if his worst nightmare was about to come true, his eyes filled with terror, his mouth wide open and screaming. Tim dropped the cards, suddenly not wanting them in his hand any longer. And that was when he saw them. Kathy and the dark-eyed man from the King of Clubs, walking toward him. Or rather not walking. For their feet didn’t seem to be quite touching the ground. They were just moving. The unnatural way they were moving was terrifying. Their dark, staring eyes were terrifying too. They were the eyes of the dead. Tim wanted to scream. In fact, he tried to scream, but his throat was so dry with terror, no sound came out. He began to run up the jetty away from them, and as he did so, he had no idea that he looked exactly like his picture on the King of Hearts. He was too terrified to think; he could only react. Which was why, when the two figures kept advancing toward him with their terrifying, empty faces, Tim jumped into the lake to escape them. As the water closed over his head and he began to kick uselessly about, he called out once, causing the deadly water to enter his mouth, “Daisy!” 1850 The tree of life Amos Wallis climbed farther up the tree. At thirty-two, he was getting quite old to climb trees, but he’d been climbing them ever since he could remember. He had climbed this particular one once or twice a week for the past three years, so often that he knew all the best places to put his hands and feet. The tree was tall, like all the other trees around it. Standing at over a hundred feet, it was a cedar tree, the type of tree the Indians called the “Tree of Life.” Once the Indians had used these trees for everything from medicine to boats. That was until they’d sold them, together with the land along by the lake, to Hayden Murray. Just the thought of it made Amos mad. Amos had hated Hayden almost from the first moment he’d met him. When they’d first moved to these parts, Amos and his wife, Cora, had thrown lots of parties to get to know the neighbors. Cora loved a good party, and since Amos owned the local store, it was good for business to be friendly. But Hayden and his wife had refused each and every invitation. It was as if they thought they were too good for everyone around here. Why, they rarely even bought anything at the store, preferring to live as if they were Indians themselves, growing vegetables and catching fish from the lake. It was such a waste. With so many people coming here to live and wanting wood to build homes, these trees were worth a lot of money. Looking down from his place up the tree, Amos could imagine a jetty heading out into the lake to make it easy to push off in a boat. He could also imagine a fine boathouse, painted dark green. No, not one boathouse, a long line of boathouses! Amos would pay good money for some of that land by the lake. Hayden had enough land so that he could sell some of it and still live apart from other people if that was what he wanted to do. But was Hayden interested in selling him the land? No, he was not. He wouldn’t even discuss it. Suddenly Kathy Murray, Hayden’s wife, came into view, walking down to the lake with a bucket to fetch water. Amos watched her, taking in the pleasing way she walked. She was a tall woman with long black hair and a good figure. Amos’s friend James West was crazy about her. Nothing new about that of course; James West was crazy about most women. The fa woman was married wouldn’t stop him. But in Kathy Murray’s case, Amos could understand it. She was a very good-looking woman. As Amos watched, Kathy reached around to the back of her red dress and began to undo it. The woman was going to wash in the lake! Up in the tree, Amos smiled to himself. James was going to be so jealous when he got back and told him about this! Down by the lake, Kathy was enjoying the sound of the cedar trees shaking in the wind. It was so peaceful here. She loved it every bit as much now as she had done five years ago when Hayden had first brought her here after they got married. Hayden. She loved him every bit as much as she had five years ago, too. It was a second marriage for her. Her first husband had been a violent man who’d believed in showing his feelings with his fists. She hadn’t been sorry when they’d come to tell her he’d died in a bar fight. She certainly hadn’t expected to marry a second time, but then along came Hayden with his calm strength and his sense of humor, and after a while she’d learned to trust again. They were so easy together, she and Hayden. Sometimes several hours went past without either of them speaking. And yet at other times he could make her laugh until she cried. He was very good at changing his voice so that he sounded like other people: the store owner Amos Wallis, for example, who always wanted to buy some of their land. “I can get you the very best price, Hayden. You’d be a fool to turn me down!” She laughed as she thought of Hayden imitating Amos’s voice. But she and Hayden didn’t want to sell their land. Why should they? Today Hayden had gone on one of his rare trips to town to get some essential supplies. Kathy was taking the opportunity to wash her hair to be pretty for him when he returned. Only somehow something felt wrong. She suddenly felt as if she weren’t alone. Holding her dress close to her body, Kathy looked around to see if someone was there. She couldn’t see anybody, but Kathy was a woman who trusted her feelings. Her life with her first husband had taught her to sense when danger was near, and it felt near now. Hoping Hayden would be back soon, Kathy quickly slipped her dress back over her head, did it up, and then filled the bucket from the lake. Then she made her way back to the safety of the house Hayden had made for them with his own hands. Amos ran into Connor O’Hara when he returned to town. Or to be more accurate, he saw O’Hara quickly leave the road and slip between two buildings the minute he saw Amos. Obviously O’Hara wasn’t too keen to see him that morning, and Amos knew why. Connor O’Hara owed him a lot of money. He hadn’t finished paying for the wood Amos had supplied him to build his home. And then there was the money he’d lost to Amos at cards the other week. It was no wonder O’Hara was trying to avoid him. Deciding it was time to talk to O’Hara about his debt, Amos carried on riding for a while, then stopped and got off his horse. Securing the animal, he walked quietly back toward the place where O’Hara was hiding. There he stopped just around the corner and waited for O’Hara to come out. O’Hara almost jumped out of his skin when he eventually emerged from between the two buildings and found him there. “Oh!” he said. “Amos! Fine day, isn’t it?” Amos moved toward O’Hara threateningly. “O’Hara,” he said, “we need to have a conversation, but not about the weather.” O’Hara didn’t bother to pretend he didn’t know what Amos was speaking about. “Please,” he begged. “Will you give me just a little more time? I promise I’ll pay you what I owe you soon. It’s just that things are a little tight at the moment. Or perhaps you’d let me work for you instead? I’d do anything, Amos. Anything.” At that moment, with Amos looking down at O’Hara’s weak face with disgust, Hayden Murray drove his horse and cart past them, sending up a cloud of dust. Amos looked around quickly, but noticed that Hayden was looking straight ahead. He obviously had no intention of greeting either of them, but there was only one place he could be heading for driving in that direction. Amos’s store. “I’ll remember you said that, O’Hara,” Amos said quickly, heading back to his horse. “When I think of something I want you to do, I’ll come and find you.” O’Hara’s face filled with relief as he watched Amos get onto his horse. “You do that, Amos. You do that,” he said. Then he hurried away before Amos could change his mind. Amos rode fast, using a back route that wasn’t suitable for horses and carts. As a result, he arrived back at his store before Hayden got there. The look of surprise on Hayden’s face when he came through the door and saw Amos there ready to serve him caused Amos great amusement. “Hayden!” Amos said with a big smile. “We haven’t seen you in town for a long while! How are things?” “Fine,” replied Hayden, walking over to look at the displays. “I need some salt.” It was obvious from every line in the man’s body how much he hated coming into the store. Amos knew he only did it when he was really forced to. The salt would be for putting on fish, to keep it good to eat during the winter months. Living where they did, Hayden and his wife had the best places to fish. The rest of them had to ride right round to the other side of the lake, a fmade Amos mad as hell every time he thought about it. Amos spoke politely, carefully keeping his bitter feelings out of his voice. “Salt. Certainly, Hayden. How much can I get for you?” As Hayden was telling him, the store door opened and James West came in. “Amos, Hayden,” James acknowledged them both. “Good morning, James,” said Amos, noticing that Hayden just nodded and looked away. Why, the man couldn’t even pretend to be polite! “We don’t see you in these parts very often, Hayden,” James was saying, but Hayden didn’t bother to reply. “Or your wife,” James continued. Amos had his back turned as he lifted the boxes of salt from a shelf, but he could still feel the sudden tension in the room. Hayden still didn’t speak, and when Amos turned with the salt, he wasn’t too surprised to see a smile on his friend’s face. James disliked Hayden Murray every bit as much as Amos did, and he loved to try to cause trouble whenever he saw him. “Your wife is just too pretty to keep hidden away, Hayden,” James was saying now in an unpleasant voice. His words got an immediate response. Hayden Murray turned around quickly to face James, his hands balled up into angry fists at his sides. Then he walked over to stand really close, using his greater height to lean right over him threateningly. “If you even look at my wife,” he said in a slow, angry voice, “I will kill you. Got it?” Then, without waiting for an answer, he turned and walked from the shop, leaving the salt behind. James was laughing almost before Hayden was out of the door. Amos came to stand next to him, and together they watched as Hayden got up onto his cart and drove away. “Oh, Amos,” smiled James, “making that man mad sure is good fun!” Amos smiled. “If you really want to have some fun, you need to come where I’ve been this morning,” he said. “Oh, yeah,” said James, interested, “where’s that?” So Amos told James all about the tree, and the view he’d almost gotten of Kathy bathing in the lake. James West smiled a big, big smile. Then he said, “Well, next time you’re going down that way, be sure to tell me about it so I can come too!” And just like that, a plan to get rid of Hayden Murray for good began to form in Amos’s mind. “Sure,” he said to James. “How about tomorrow?” The weather was fine at the moment, but fall was here and the weather would soon turn bad. Salt or no salt, Amos reckoned Hayden would be out on the lake fishing the next morning. James grinned at him. “Tomorrow is just fine for me,” he agreed. They set off at mid-morning the next day. There were three of them, since Amos had asked Connor O’Hara to come along, too. James wasn’t too pleased about that. “What’s he coming along for?” he complained. Amos smiled. “O’Hara here is our security,” he said. “He’s good with a gun, aren’t you, O’Hara?” “I sure am,” agreed O’Hara. James frowned. “You aren’t expecting any trouble, are you, Amos?” he asked. Amos began to ride off. “Of course not,” he said over his shoulder. “Like I said, O’Hara’s just our security.” Unlike Amos, James was not used to climbing trees. It took him a long time to get high enough up to be able to get a good view of the lakeside. Then, when he was up there, he held on tight, his face white with fear, waiting for Kathy to come out. But when she finally did, James began to smile and forgot all about being afraid. “There she is!” he said. “She got her clothes off yet?” asked O’Hara, who was waiting at the bottom of the tree with Amos. “No!” complained James. “She’s washing clothes, not taking them off!” Down at the bottom of the tree, O’Hara thought this was a very funny joke, and laughed loudly. Then James said, “Wait a minute! She’s talking to somebody! It’s Hayden in his boat! You got your times wrong, Amos! Hayden’s back!” Amos hid a smile. He hadn’t gotten his times wrong at all. Things were happening exactly as he’d hoped they would. After long months of watching Hayden and Kathy Murray, he knew their habits. He’d also suspected that James would panic and make a lot of noise as he came down from the tree. And since he fell half the way and screamed loudly as he hit the ground, that was exactly what he did. Within seconds, Hayden Murray had come running through the trees to find out what was happening. “Just a little accident, Hayden,” Amos told him smoothly. “Yeah,” said O’Hara helpfully. “West here fell from the tree while he was trying to see your wife with no clothes on!” On hearing this, Hayden’s face turned purple. For a moment he looked as if he couldn’t decide who to hit first. Then he made his mind up and threw himself toward West. But before he could get there, O’Hara shot him. And just like that, Hayden Murray was dead. At the sound of the shot, Kathy began to run through the trees toward them. “Hayden!” she screamed. “Hayden!” When she arrived, she threw herself down on the ground next to him and took his lifeless body in her arms. “What have you done?” she asked. “What have you done?” She was crying loudly, rocking her body backward and forward as she held onto Hayden. “He was going to kill West,” Amos said coolly. “O’Hara here had to shoot him. He had no choice.” ”He was like an animal,” O’Hara confirmed. Kathy pressed herself against Hayden’s broken chest and didn’t speak. James West moved toward her. “Come, Kathy,” he said. “You’re better off without the man. Like O’Hara says, he was an animal. After a little while, you’ll come to see . . .” He reached out to touch her, but Kathy moved back, her face wild. “Stay away from me!” she screamed. “Don’t touch me!” There was so much hatred in her voice that West froze, his face turning red. “He was better than all of you!” Kathy continued wildly. “You murdered him! And I won’t rest until the world knows what you’ve done!” Amos looked at her coldly. “Is that so, my dear?” he said. Then he nodded toward O’Hara. “O’Hara,” he said, “you know what you have to do.” O’Hara didn’t hesitate. Amos had promised to forget about his debt if he helped him out today. So he raised his gun and pointed it at Kathy, thinking of freedom. With a cry, Kathy let go of Hayden and began to run through the trees, trying to escape. O’Hara set off after her. “Do we have to kill her?” West asked Amos as they began to follow. “You know we do,” Amos replied. “She’ll talk otherwise. Besides, you saw the way she just looked at you. Don’t waste your pity. She’s as bad as Hayden.” Kathy reached the edge of the trees. Her heart was racing. She didn’t know where she was running to or why. Hayden was dead. Dead! What was there to live for now? And yet something deep inside her refused to let the three men get everything they wanted. Reaching down, she grabbed hold of a large branch. Then, as O’Hara drew close, she turned and hit him with it with all her remaining strength. The gun flew out of his hand. She picked it up. Then she turned to face all three men, pointing the gun at them. Her hand and her arm were shaking, and her clothes were wet with Hayden’s blood. Amos laughed at her. “Somehow, I don’t feel very afraid,” he said. “How about you, gentlemen?” O’Hara was still rubbing the arm where the branch had hit him, but he smiled at that. West was still looking angry because of Kathy’s rejection. “Well,” said Kathy, walking backward toward the water. “You should be afraid. You should all be afraid. Because I curse you!” O’Hara laughed at that. “The little lady thinks she can do Indian magic!” he said. Amos smiled. Kathy had reached the water by now. There was nowhere for her to go. She was trapped. “I curse you and your families!” Kathy continued, and there was such poison in her voice that the three men all stopped smiling. “May you all die young. May everyone in your families die young! From this day on until the end of time!” “That’s enough!” said Amos, holding out his hand. “Now, give me the gun.” But Kathy ignored him, still walking backward into the water. It was up to her knees now. Amos walked toward her. And as he did, Kathy began to shoot. Quickly, Amos threw himself onto the ground. O’Hara and West ran into the trees. Then Kathy let the gun go and began to swim. By the time the three men looked again, she had reached a place where an underground river joined the lake and the current was strong. And there she stopped swimming and let the angry waters claim her. When they went to look, there was nothing for them to see but a faint red circle of water, gradually making its way toward where they stood on the shore.

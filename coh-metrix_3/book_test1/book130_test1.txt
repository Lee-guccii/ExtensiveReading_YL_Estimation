Set a goal Before you make a plan for your trip, you need to think. You have to decide two things: what do you have, and what do you want? When you organize your trip, you should first make a budget. You should decide how much money and time you have. A good travel plan cannot require more money than you have. It cannot take more time than you have . After you make your budget, you can decide what kind of experiences you want to have on your trip. Set some goals for: • eating delicious food • visiting famous or interesting sites • learning about new cultures • having new experiences • seeing great places and views • trying something different • meeting new people • making happy memories You should decide what you want to do most on your trip. You can then prioritize that goal. Make it number one on your list. If you are traveling with friends, make sure they have the same goals as you. Make sure they have the same budget. Use your budget and the goals you prioritized to help you organize the best trip for you! Remember, you may not have much time or money. But, you can still do a lot on your trip if you plan well and set goals. 2. Choose a destination Maybe, you already know where you want to go. Or, maybe, you know that you want to go to a beach. But, you haven’t decided on which beach yet. There is lots of information on the Internet. It can help you choose a destination for your trip. Look at travel websites or travel videos online to get some good ideas. Also, check travel agencies. They may have a cheap travel plan. When you find a destination you want to visit, check the weather. Some places are better to visit in the summer. And, some places are better to visit in the winter. Remember, it can be a different season at your destination! When choosing a destination, make sure you have enough time available. You need time to travel to the destination and time to travel back. How much of your time do you want to spend traveling to your destination? The more time you spend in a car or on a plane, the less time you will have at your destination. Sometimes, it’s better to choose a location that is nearer to you. Then, you will have more time to enjoy it! There are so many great destinations to visit. So, it’s a good idea to choose two or three places. Then, decide which one is best. 3. Find out about your destination After choosing your travel destination, you should find information about it. You can use this information to help you make your plan. Use the Internet and magazines from travel agencies. Read travel websites for your destination. Watch online videos. Also, check official websites for tourists. You should check the official tourism websites for both your own country and your destination country. These websites will often have very important information. For example, there will be information about how to keep safe. There will be vaccination information. And, there will be information about common scams – how people may try to trick tourists. While you are learning about your destination, you can check what language is spoken there. If it is different from your own language, you might try to study the new language. It will help you communicate with the people. And, it will feel much more exciting and interesting to speak in the local language. You can also learn about the history of your destination. There might be some famous people from there. There might be some famous places or World Heritage Sites that you could visit. Maybe, there were many famous events in the past. Sometimes, places hold festivals to remember these kinds of events. By learning about the history, you can enjoy these festivals much more. It will also help you organize your trip. 4. Prioritize your activities When you set your goals for your trip, you prioritize your most important activities and goals. This helps you make a list of things you want to do at your destination. Do you like trying new food? Do you want to visit a history or art museum? Do you want to try climbing a mountain? Maybe, you just want to relax, and sit on a beach. Everyone has different goals for their trip. A good trip usually has different activities. Plan to visit an old place that has lots of history. Then visit a new modern building. Try a new activity like riding a horse. Eat some food that is famous. Try something that is an important part of the culture of the country of your destination. Some events may happen only during one of the seasons. They may happen on a special date. Then, you should prioritize these events. You should make sure to go. Here are some examples of interesting seasonal events: Fireworks, summer festivals, viewing young tropical fish, snow festivals, tomato throwing festivals, harvest festivals, strawberry picking, flower fields, sports events, mountain climbing paths, and river boat rides. There may also be some food that is available only during one of the seasons. You should make sure to try it. Prioritize the things you want to do. 5. Make a clear travel plan It’s important to have a clear travel plan for your trip. How will you get there? Where will you sleep? How will you get from one place to another? Will you travel to your destination by plane? Then, check the prices of tickets. It is easy to buy tickets at a travel agency. But, you can usually save money by buying your plane tickets online. There are many websites that can help you find cheap ticket prices. You should make sure to look at a map of your destination. How big is the country? Does it take a long time to get around it? Learn about how people travel in that area. People might use taxis, motorcycles, trains, ferries, planes, buses, or something else! If you plan to walk a lot, stay at a hotel that is close to the places you want to visit. If you plan to take taxis, make sure you have enough money in your travel budget. Know how much time it takes to get around your destination area. This is important for planning your activities. Maybe, there is an interesting place you want to visit. But, it could be far away. You may decide it is too far. Or, you may change your hotel for that day. You could stay at one nearer the place you want to visit. 6. Manage your money There are lots of things that people spend money on when they go on a trip. It is important to make a budget. You need to think about how much money you have for shopping, food, drinks, souvenirs, travel costs, hotel costs, and other activities. It’s also a good idea to take some more money for emergencies. When traveling, you should keep your money in different places. Take some spending money out with you. Have some money in your wallet. Have some money in your bag. But, also keep some money at your hotel. This way, if something is lost or stolen, you still have some money. It’s also important to learn about the money that people use in your destination country. It may be different than the money you usually use. So, you should learn about these differences. You should learn what the money looks like. Get used to using your destination’s money before you arrive. Then, you can understand how much everything costs. This will help you manage your budget. It will help make sure you don’t pay too much for something. It will also help make sure you don’t get scammed. Remember, how you spend your money is your choice. But, make sure you have enough. Make sure you keep your money safe. And, make sure you understand the local money of the country that you will visit. 7. Pack your bags Don’t wait until the last minute to start deciding what to bring on your trip. Make a list of important things you want to bring. Add more things to the list when you get a good idea. You should start making your list a few weeks before you go on your trip. Here are some ideas of what you should bring with you: • Your passport (with a copy saved on your phone) • Plane tickets (or boarding passes if you checked in online) • Money • Medicine • A paper from your doctor that says which vaccinations you had. • A paper with your friends’ phone numbers, and local emergency phone numbers for tourists • Travel adapters Put any important papers inside a plastic bag. They will be safe if your travel bag gets wet. Take a photograph of important papers with your phone to make copies. Also, take a photograph of your suitcase and travel bags with your phone. This way, you can show it to airport workers or police if your bag is lost or stolen. It’s a good idea to bring some souvenirs from home as gifts for the people you meet on your trip. Small gifts are a great way to make friends and to say thank you. Finally, remember to download any maps that you might need onto your phone before you go. If you cannot get online, you will have these important maps with you. 8. Talk with your travel partners Traveling with friends can give you wonderful experiences together. You will have memories that you can talk about together. And, your friendship will grow stronger. But, traveling can also give you lots of stress. This stress can cause problems for your friendship. The best way to not have any problems is to talk together before you go on your trip. Look at your lists of goals. Did you prioritize the same goals? Or, do you have different ideas? Do you all have enough money in your budget for your goals? Don’t wait until the last minute to talk to your travel partners. You may have very different goals. And, you will need to work together to make a plan that makes everyone happy. If you are going on a long trip together, you could schedule some days where each person does something different. This way, you can have lots of experiences together. But, you can also enjoy activities that only you are interested in doing. Or, you can have each person plan one day for what they want to do. On that day, everyone follows that plan. This is an interesting way to organize a trip, because you will often do many different activities. These activities will be new things. Things you have not thought of doing yourself. Trying different activities can be interesting and fun. 9. Change the plan No plan is perfect. We now have lots of information to help us to plan, thanks to the Internet. However, there is some information you can only get when you are actually at your destination. You can get the best information from talking to the local people who live there. Talk to hotel workers and other tourists, too. They can tell you about the best restaurants. They can tell you the best way to go somewhere. And, they can tell you about the famous places in that area to visit. They can also tell you about how to stay safe. You should be ready to change your plan to include this new information. You should also have a plan for bad weather. It’s difficult to enjoy the beach in the rain. Instead, find something indoors to do. This way, you don’t have to spend your time waiting for the weather to get better. Here are some good ideas for rainy day activities. Visit: Aquariums, museums, restaurants, theaters, shopping malls, and building or factory tours. You could also try an indoor experience. For example: get a massage, learn a local dance, wear interesting cultural clothing, drink local wine, make local crafts, or meet new people in a coffee shop. Remember, there will always be changes to your plan. Don’t worry! Enjoy each day. 10. Don’t make a plan Planning too much can take the fun out of a trip. There need to be some surprises. Your trip needs to feel like an adventure. But, if you plan too much, it might feel more like a job. It might feel like something you have to do. “What? Why did I just read this book if I shouldn’t make a plan?” Maybe that’s what you’re thinking. Of course, it’s easier and safer to be organized. It is good to make a plan. You should do this for your first few trips. When you get used to traveling, though, you can try traveling with only a simple plan. Or, you can try having no plan at all! Then, your trip will really feel like an adventure. Just remember: Don’t be too busy trying to follow your own plan. You might miss the chance to try something new. Sometimes, you have to forget your plan. That is usually the time when you will find something very surprising. And, this can become the greatest memory for the whole trip.

Coming home I was enjoying the drive from Harlingen airport. It was late September, and the trees were a beautiful orange color. Where I lived in New York, I used the train to get to work. But here in the open country of Texas, it was good to be in a car again. I felt free for the first time in weeks. Texas was still home to me, even though I lived in New York. I grew up in Texas, and it was in my blood. I always came back to stay with my mother if my life got difficult and I needed some time to think. It was a good place to sort out my problems, like my work and Tyler. “Tyler isn’t a problem,” I thought as I drove. “He’s a good man. It’s great that he wants to marry you.” Yet somehow something felt wrong, and so I was here, on my way to Texas to think things over. But I didn’t want to think about it yet. I was almost home now—just a few more miles to go. I smiled as I thought about my mother. I loved her very much, and she loved me. But we were very different, and we often disagreed. I really hoped we wouldn’t fight this time. I wanted a quiet vacation. Moments later I was at Mom’s. I turned in and drove up to the house. I loved the approach to the house; there were tall trees and always lots of color. Mom’s an artist, and she often paints outside. I stopped the car and got out. “Mom!” I called, but there was no answer so I left my bags in the car and walked toward the house. Mom often gets lost in her work and forgets the time, so I pushed open the door and went in. And there was Mom, sitting very close to a man on the sofa. A young man. Mom’s forty-nine, but the man looked the same age as me. I stopped to look at them, and the smile left my face. Mom was laughing like a girl and touching the man’s arm. He was smiling back at her. I couldn’t believe it. Not again! Last time Mom had a young boyfriend, he broke her heart. Suddenly the man noticed me. He looked up. “You have a visitor, Caroline,” he said in a deep voice. I saw that his hair was black and his face was strong. Mom looked up. For a moment, she didn’t look too pleased to see me. Then she quickly smiled. “Alyssa!” she said. “You’re here already!” “It’s eleven o’clock,” I told her coldly. “I said I’d get here around eleven.” “You know me,” Mom said. “I never wear a watch. Anyway, come and meet Zach. Zach, this is my daughter, Alyssa.” Zach got to his feet. He was a tall man with a good body. I didn’t want to notice it, but it was difficult not to. There was a kind of power about the man. “Hello,” he said and held out his hand. I didn’t want to take it, and I didn’t want to know anything about him. Mom’s boyfriends are only around for a short time. “Aren’t you going to shake hands with Zach, Alyssa?” Mom asked, speaking to me as if I were nine, not twenty-nine. I felt angry at her, and it showed in my face as I shook Zach’s hand. “Good to meet you, Alyssa,” Zach said. His eyes were very blue, and they looked right into mine. He was still smiling, and I thought he was the type of man who wanted all women to like him. And the type who likes rich, older women. Mom’s paintings sell for a lot of money; that’s usually why younger men want to be her boyfriend. “You look tired, Alyssa,” Mom said. I felt tired suddenly. I had come here to get away from problems, but Zach looked like a big problem to me. “I am,” I said. “It’s a long way from New York.” “I’ll get going now, Caroline,” Zach said. “So soon?” Mom said. Zach smiled. “I’ve got work to do. And you’ll want to speak to your daughter.” “All right,” Mom said. “But come back very soon.” “I will,” Zach said, then he smiled at me. “Good to meet you, Alyssa.” “Good-bye,” I said, and he left. “I can’t believe you’re seeing a younger man again,” I told Mom when we were alone. Mom looked at me for a long time. “You never change, do you?” she said. “Neither do you!” I said. Great! We were already fighting! “Look, Mom,” I said more quietly. “I just got here. I don’t want to fight with you. Let’s not talk about Zach, OK?” “If that’s what you want,” Mom said. “I’ll make us some coffee.” While I waited for Mom to come back, I looked around the room. Everything was the same, but there was a new painting on the wall. It was a painting of a man—a portrait, just of his head and the top half of his body. His hair was white and his eyes were as blue as the sky. I knew him—it was Mike Anderson. He lived a few miles away from here. Why did Mom have a painting of Mike Anderson on her wall, I wondered? Mom came back with the coffee. “How’s work?” she asked. As soon as she spoke, I stopped thinking about the painting of Mike Anderson. A little girl’s face came into my mind, Emily’s face. As I remembered, I felt sad all over again. I knew I probably needed to talk to Mom about it. I certainly needed to talk to someone about it. But I just couldn’t. Not yet. “Do you mind if we don’t talk about work?” I asked Mom. “Things haven’t been great just lately.” Mom looked at me. “What do you want to talk about then? That boyfriend of yours? Taylor?” “Tyler,” I told her. “His name’s Tyler. He . . . he asked me to marry him.” Mom’s eyes opened wide. “Did he?” she said. “And what did you say?” I looked down at my cup of coffee. “I said yes,” I told her quietly. “Well,” said Mom. “You’re getting married. I’m not surprised. Last time I saw you it was ‘Taylor this,’ and ‘Taylor that’ all the time. I got tired of hearing his name.” She looked at my hand. “Didn’t he give you a ring? You’re not wearing one.” I thought about Tyler’s face in the restaurant as he gave me a little red box with a ring in it. “I hope you like it,” he had said, his eyes full of love. “Yes, he gave me a ring,” I told Mom now. “But it’s a little big for me. He’s going to change it.” Mom was looking at me. “What is it, Alyssa?” she asked. “You don’t seem happy. Is something wrong?” Suddenly I felt very tired. I didn’t want to talk about Tyler. I didn’t even want to think about Tyler. “No, nothing’s wrong,” I lied. “Why don’t you show me your new paintings?” Mom put her coffee cup down and got up. “OK,” she said. “But I know something is wrong between you and Taylor, and I want to know what it is. We’ll speak about it again later.” “Tyler!” I said as I walked after her. “His name is Tyler!” But Mom just laughed. The gate Mom always paints in the afternoons. It’s her best time for working. “Do you want me to leave it today?” she asked. “I will, if you want.” “No,” I said. “You paint. I’ll go for a walk.” “Why don’t you go out for a ride on Rusty?” Mom suggested. I smiled. “Great idea,” I said. “I’ll go and get changed. See you later.” I put on some long pants and a shirt and then I hurried outside. Rusty was in the field behind the house. “Hello, boy!” I called to him, and he looked up and came quickly over. He seemed pleased to see me. I love horses. It was another thing I liked about coming to see Mom, being able to ride Rusty. Soon I was riding Rusty out of Mom’s garden. A mile or two along the road was Anderson’s Ranch. Mike Anderson never minded me riding across his land, and I loved it there. As I left, I remembered the painting. “I must ask Mom about it later,” I thought. As I rode along, I looked at the trees. They were so beautiful in their autumn colors. There were trees in New York, of course, lots of them, in Central Park. But somehow that was different. Central Park had roads all around it. You could always hear the cars and the busy city. As I rode along with the sun on my face, I felt relaxed for the first time in weeks. I knew I had to think about my problems at work and my feelings for Tyler soon, but for now I just wanted to enjoy the moment. But when I got to Anderson’s Ranch, I was surprised to find a new gate to stop people going in. I got down from Rusty and tried to open the gate, but it was locked. Then I noticed a sign. KEEP OUT! “Well!” I said to Rusty. “That’s not very friendly, is it?” I got back up onto Rusty’s back, trying to decide where to go for my ride now. Just then a car came along the road and stopped in front of the gate. A man got out. It was Zach. “Oh, no!” I thought. “Well,” Zach said. “Hello again.” He went over to the gate. “It’s locked,” I told him. He smiled up at me. “I know,” he said. “I locked it.” I looked at the sign again. KEEP OUT! Those two unfriendly words made me feel mad. “Mr. Anderson always lets me ride across his land,” I told Zach. Zach looked at me. “Mike Anderson is my father,” he told me. “He’s gone on a long vacation.” I looked at Zach and saw the same strong face as in the painting on Mom’s wall. “I didn’t know Mr. Anderson had a son,” I said. “I’ve been away for a few years,” Zach explained. “But now I’m back.” “And you don’t want people on your land,” I said. “No,” he said, “I don’t.” I decided I really didn’t like Zach. “People around here don’t lock gates,” I told him. “They’re friendly.” I was still mad, and it showed in my voice. “Do you always do that?” Zach asked. I didn’t know what he was talking about. “Do I always do what?” “Do you always think badly of people when you don’t even know them?” He was smiling up at me. The smile made me even madder. “Of course not,” I said. “I say what I see. A locked gate is unfriendly.” “I’m a friendly man,” Zach said. “Ask your mother.” That was too much. “Oh,” I said, “I’m sure you’re very friendly to her! Come on, Rusty.” And I began to ride away. “Wait, Alyssa,” Zach called after me. “There is a good reason why I lock the gates to the ranch now.” I looked back. “It’s your ranch. You don’t have to explain.” “No,” he agreed. “I don’t. But I want to. Read this.” And he showed me another, smaller sign at the other end of the gate. I rode Rusty over to take a look. There was a picture of what looked like a wild cat and some large words. OCELOTS LIVE HERE! I couldn’t read the rest of it; the words were too small. I was interested though, so I got down from Rusty so I could see better. As I read the sign, Zach began to talk. “I found out that a pair of ocelots were living on the ranch shortly after I came here,” he told me. “There aren’t many in Texas anymore.” I still felt a little mad, so I didn’t want to be interested. But I was interested. I didn’t know a lot about ocelots, only that they were small wild cats. “Why is that?” I asked. “A lot of the places they like to live in are gone,” Zach explained. “They like brush, wild areas of the countryside with lots of small trees. Also, as they move about looking for food and somewhere to live, they’re often killed on the roads.” “That’s so sad!” I said, and I turned to look at him. He was standing close to me. “It is,” he agreed. “They’re such beautiful animals. I wanted to try to do something for them.” I couldn’t look away. “I see,” I said, and suddenly I felt very small. I wished I had let Zach explain about the gate before I got angry with him. “How are you helping the ocelots?” I asked. “What can you do?” “I can keep some of my land the way they like it,” he said, then he smiled. “And I can try to keep people away.” My face went red. “Yes,” I said. “I see. Look . . . I’m sorry I was mad at you.” “That’s OK,” he said. “You didn’t know.” “No,” I said. “But . . .” “Alyssa,” Zach said, and his voice was soft and strong at the same time. “It’s OK.” I felt hot. Zach was still very close and he was looking right at me. His eyes were very blue. I can really understand why Mom likes this man, I thought. “Listen,” Zach said, still in that same soft voice. “Why don’t you come over to try and see the ocelots?” I didn’t stop to think. “Oh, I’d love to!” I said, smiling. Zach smiled back. “Great!” he said. “Evening’s the best time to see them. What about tomorrow evening? Come about six and we can eat first.” “Oh,” I said, and I thought about Mom. And Tyler. Going over to see the ocelots seemed different from going to see them and eating with Zach. “What’s wrong?” Zach asked. “Er . . . nothing,” I said. “I just . . . Well, I don’t know about eating with you.” “My food’s quite good,” Zach said. “Ask your mom.” He was still smiling, and I started to feel angry again. Who did he think he was? Asking me to eat with him when he was seeing Mom? “I’m sure it is,” I said coldly. “But I don’t think Mom would like me to eat with you.” “Caroline won’t mind,” he said. “You’re a big girl now.” Then he looked at my face. “Oh,” he said. “You didn’t think . . .? No, Alyssa, you’ve got it wrong. Your mom and I are just friends, that’s all. She’s painting a picture of an ocelot for me. I’m going to sell it at the Texas Ocelot Festival next February.” “Oh,” I said. I didn’t know what else to say. I remembered how I hadn’t given Mom the chance to explain about Zach and I felt silly. “I . . . well, when I saw the two of you together, I just thought . . .” “No,” Zach said again. “I like Caroline very much. She’s a nice woman and a very good artist. But that’s all.” “Oh,” I said again. “I see. I seem to keep getting things wrong, don’t I?” Zach smiled. “We all do it.” Rusty suddenly moved, pushing his long nose between Zach and me. We both laughed. “Somebody wants to get moving,” he said. “Look, you can ride on my land if you stay down this end. The ocelots keep to the brush on the other side.” “Thanks,” I said. “That would be great.” I got back onto Rusty’s back and Zach smiled up at me. “So,” he said. “Do you want to come over here tomorrow?” I thought about Tyler and knew I should answer . . . No. “Yes,” I said. “I’d love to.” Zach smiled. “Great,” he said. “Enjoy your ride.” Talking to Tyler That evening, I finally asked Mom about the painting of Mike Anderson. “I painted it for his wife,” Mom told me. “She asked me to do it before she died. Afterwards, Mike didn’t want it. I think it made him sad. But I like it, so I put it on my wall.” “When did she die?” I asked. “Over a year ago now,” Mom told me. “It was very sad. She and Mike were great together.” I thought about Tyler. Would we be great together if we got married? Mom looked at me. “You’re thinking about Tyler,” she said. I didn’t reply. “Don’t you want to marry him?” Mom continued. “Oh, I don’t know,” I said. “I felt so good when he asked me to marry him. That’s why I said ‘yes.’ He’s such a nice man, Mom. And he has a good job . . .” “He doesn’t sound very interesting,” Mom said. I looked at her. “Most moms would like their daughter to marry a nice man with a good job,” I told her. Mom smiled. “I’m not most moms,” she said. “That’s true,” I agreed thoughtfully. Had I accepted Tyler because of Mom? Tyler was a good man who was always there when you needed him. Mom’s boyfriends weren’t like that. Dad wasn’t like that. Mom took my hand. “I just want you to be happy, Alyssa,” she said. “And you don’t seem to love Tyler enough to be happy.” The phone started to ring. Mom went to answer it. She soon came back. “It’s Tyler,” she said. I didn’t want to speak to him, but I knew I had to. “Hello,” I said. “Alyssa!” Tyler said. “It’s so good to hear your voice! Did you get there OK? Oh, I miss you so much, I can’t tell you . . .” Mom left the room, and I took the phone over to the sofa. “Alyssa?” Tyler said. “Are you still there?” “Yes,” I answered. “I’m here.” “You’re very quiet,” Tyler said. “Are you OK?” “Yes, I’m OK,” I said, but I didn’t feel OK. There was so much love in Tyler’s voice, and I felt very bad. I liked Tyler very much, but I knew I didn’t feel as much for him as he felt for me. “I’m just tired, I guess,” I said. It was true. I was tired suddenly. “You’re thinking about work, aren’t you?” Tyler said. “Not really,” I said, but suddenly I was. “Yes, you are!” Tyler said. “I know you are. Look, Alyssa, you couldn’t do anything to stop what happened. Nobody could.” Tyler’s voice was very kind. “Anyway,” he continued, ‘you won’t need to work when we get married. I’ve got a good job. We won’t need the money.” For a moment, I thought about the life Tyler was offering me. A house, a family, enough money, and a man to take care of me. Tyler loved me and he wanted to take all my problems away. At the moment the idea of not having anything to worry about seemed like a nice idea. But I was tired just now. The last few weeks had been really bad. I knew I probably wouldn’t feel the same way after a while. My work was important to me. “Tyler,” I said softly, “I don’t think I should have agreed to marry you.” Tyler didn’t speak for a moment. When he did, his voice sounded hurt. “You don’t mean that, Alyssa,” he said. “You’re just worried about work. You don’t know what you’re saying.” “I am worried about work,” I agreed. “It’s true. Everything in my life feels wrong at the moment. I don’t even know if I want to live in the city any more. But listen, Tyler, that isn’t why I’m saying . . .” Once again, Tyler didn’t let me finish. “We’ll move then!” he said. “We don’t have to live in the city.” “Oh, Tyler,” I said. “You’re a city man. You love the city.” “I love you more,” he said. “I don’t want to live in the city without you.” I closed my eyes. “I’m sorry, Tyler,” I said. “I’m really, really sorry. But I think it’s over.” After I finally said good-bye to Tyler, Mom came back into the room. She looked at my face. “Oh dear,” she said. “I told him I don’t think I can marry him,” I said. “Oh,” she said. “And I’m guessing he wasn’t happy about that?” “No,” I said sadly. “He wouldn’t accept it. He wants me to wait until he can see me before I finally decide.” “Well,” Mom said. “Maybe that’s a good idea. If you listen to what he has to say, you’ll know what you want to do.” I looked at her. “Thanks,” I said. “I mean, for listening to me.” “That’s OK,” she said. “You listen to me when I break up with people. When you’re here, anyway.” “I want to be here more often,” I told her. She smiled at me again. “Good,” she said. I smiled back, my mind busy. Would I be happy if I lived here again? Not here with Mom, but back in Texas? It was true, I wasn’t happy living in the city anymore. It wasn’t just that things had been bad at work lately. New York was too big for me. I wanted to be somewhere quieter. Somewhere you could still see ocelots living in the brush. There were no ocelots in New York. “I’m going over to Zach’s tomorrow,” I told Mom. The smile left Mom’s face. “He asked you over there?” she said. “When did you see him?” I looked at her. “Outside his ranch,” I said. “He let me ride Rusty there.” “So why has he asked you to his house?” “Well, to have something to eat and to try to see . . .” I stopped speaking. Mom’s face was suddenly really cold. “Is something wrong?” I asked her. “You only just told Tyler you think you can’t marry him!” she said. I felt bad. “I know,” I said. “But. . .” “Is that why you finished with Tyler?” Mom asked angrily. “Because you’ve decided you like Zach?” I didn’t understand why she was so mad. “No!” I said. “It’s not like that at all! I just suddenly knew I didn’t want to marry Tyler.” Mom wasn’t listening. “After you met Zach,” she said. “You knew you couldn’t marry Tyler after you met Zach.” I was mad now too. “It’s got nothing to do with Zach!” I said, then something about her face made me realize what was wrong. “Mom?” I asked more quietly. “Do you like Zach?” She got up from the sofa and looked down at me. “Of course I like him!” she told me. “You could see that when you arrived here!” “I’m sorry,” I said. “But Zach said . . .” I didn’t finish. “What?” Mom asked angrily. “What did Zach say? That he doesn’t feel that way about me? That I’m too old for him? That we’re just friends? Well, I’ve got news for you, Alyssa, Zach’s a man! And like all men, you can’t believe anything he says! I just know how he looks at me when we go out to dinner, and it’s not the way you look at a friend, believe me!” I didn’t know what to think. Mom seemed so sure. “Look,” I said at last. “I only wanted to see the ocelots. But I won’t go over there if you don’t want me to.” Mom was still mad. “You do what you like, Alyssa,” she said. “You usually do!” And she left the room. A little while later, I heard the door to her studio close loudly behind her. Sad beauty I didn’t see much of Mom the next day. She left the house soon after breakfast. “I’m going to Brownsville on business. I’ll be out all day,” she said, and then she was gone. I spent the day reading, walking and trying not to think. By five-thirty, I still didn’t know if I was going to go to see Zach or not. But at six o’clock, I drove up to his ranch house. “Hi!” he called to me with a big smile. I didn’t smile back. “Hello,” I said more quietly. Zach looked at me. I think he knew something was wrong, but he decided not to talk about it. “I thought we could eat outside,” he said. “It’s a nice evening.” He was wearing jeans and a black shirt. The shirt made his hair look very black. I didn’t want to notice, but I did. “Yes,” I said. “It is a nice evening.” Zach was looking at me. “Well,” he said. “Take a seat. The food will be another fifteen minutes. Can I get you coffee while you wait?” I sat down on one of the garden chairs. “Yes, please,” I said, “with cream.” “Right,” Zach said. “I’ll go and get it.” A few minutes later he came back, with coffee for us— cream for me, black for him. I took the coffee from him. “Thank you.” We drank quietly for a moment. I looked away from him, out at the garden. I kept thinking about Mom the evening before, how sure she was that Zach liked her as more than just a friend. Someone was wrong, but who? “So, what do you do in New York, Alyssa?” Zach asked me after a while. “What’s your work?” “I write for the New York Post,” I told him. “You’re a journalist?” he asked. “That’s interesting.” Interesting. Well, yes, being a journalist was interesting sometimes. Often, in fact. But just lately, being a journalist had also made me feel like a useless failure. “I don’t really want to talk about work if you don’t mind,” I said. “Oh,” Zach said. “All right.” There was silence between us then for ages. Finally it began to feel uncomfortable and I just had to say something. “What about you?” I asked. “Are you happy here on the ranch?” “Yes,” Zach said. “I am. I like working with the animals.” He looked at me and smiled. “My father’s coming back soon though,” he said. “I don’t know if he’s going to let me do things my way or not.” I thought about the picture of Mike Anderson and the sad story of Zach’s mother. “Mom told me about your mom,” I said. “I’m sorry.” Zach looked sad. “Thanks,” he said. “She loved this place.” “It’s certainly lovely,” I said. The ranch house was a long, low building painted dark red. There were tall trees all around it, and everywhere there were sounds of life. “There are so many different sounds,” I said. Zach smiled. “Yes,” he agreed. “Nature’s doing her very best for you tonight.” I didn’t want to smile back, but somehow I couldn’t help it. I liked the idea that nature was putting on a show for me. “That’s better,” Zach said, talking about my smile. “That’s the first time you’ve smiled since you got here.” I stopped smiling immediately, and Zach looked at me. “Alyssa,” he asked. “Is something wrong?” I couldn’t tell Zach about Mom. If it was all in Mom’s head, then she would look bad. And yet if I didn’t talk to Zach about it, how would I learn the truth? “No,” I said. “Nothing’s wrong.” I decided to try to make him think about something else. “Tell me about the Texas Ocelot Festival,” I asked him. “What happens?” “Well,” Zach said. “It’s held in February every year. There’s a lot of information about ocelots, and people do lots of things to make money. The money goes to help ocelots in the wild. I think your mom’s painting will make a lot of money.” Great, we were back to Mom! “I hope we see some ocelots tonight,” I said. Zach looked at me. “I hope we do too,” he said. We didn’t talk much as we ate our food, but somehow it didn’t seem unusual to be quiet. Nature was all around us, and the sky changed color until it was pink and orange. There was a lot to look at, and it was all very beautiful. “I’ve missed this,” I thought as I sat and looked. “I’ve missed this so much.” “Shall we go and see some ocelots?” Zach asked at last, and I gave him a small smile. “Yes, please.” Fifteen minutes later, we were sitting in a little house close to the area of brush where Zach said the ocelots lived. “Was this place here already?” I asked Zach. “No,” he said. “I built two of these hides last year to help me watch the ocelots. When I’m in here, they don’t usually notice me.” “The green paint is the same color as the brush,” I said. He smiled at me. “That was the plan,” he said. We were speaking softly as we waited for the ocelots. We didn’t want them to hear us. The hide was small; there was just enough room for Zach and me to sit together to look out of the window. Zach’s leg was touching mine, and I was very aware of him. Zach was a very attractive man and something in me was drawn to him. But I knew I mustn’t feel like that and I tried to move my leg away from him. He noticed and looked down at me. Then, just as he was about to say something, there was a sound outside. Zach touched my arm and we both looked out of the window. And there, coming out of the brush toward us, was an ocelot. I smiled quickly at Zach and then looked back. The ocelot was beautiful. It was a little bigger than a house cat, and it had no idea Zach and I were there at all. As we watched, it turned toward the brush and made a calling sound. And then two small ocelot cubs came running out too. I couldn’t believe it. The cubs were running about and playing. It was beautiful. We watched them for about five minutes, and then the mother walked away with the cubs running after her. “That was so lovely,” I started to say. “I’ve never seen anything so . . . so . . .” I didn’t realize I was crying until Zach reached out to touch my wet face. “Alyssa?” he asked softly. “What’s wrong?” “Nothing,” I said, but suddenly I couldn’t stop crying. I wasn’t thinking about the ocelots anymore. I was thinking about another baby animal, a child’s toy animal, Emily’s toy animal. One bad thing too many “Tell me, Alyssa,” Zach said softly. “Tell me what’s wrong.” And somehow I did. “There was a little girl, Emily,” I said. “She . . . she was killed in New York. She was missing for weeks; someone took her from her house.” “I remember reading about it,” Zach said. His voice was caring and kind. “Poor kid.” I looked up at him. “It was my story for the paper,” I told him. “I wrote about it every day: what happened, how the parents felt, everything. I got to know the police officers who were working on the case, and because of that . . .” “You found out all the details.” I could see by Zach’s face that he understood. “Yes. It . . . it just got to me, I don’t know why.” Zach had his arm around me. It felt good. “It was a bad, bad thing, that’s why,” he said. “But a journalist’s work is almost always to write about bad things,” I said. “Maybe this was one bad thing too many,” Zach suggested. “Maybe,” I said. We didn’t speak for a while, and then Zach looked at me. “Is that why you came to Texas? For a break?” I remembered Tyler. “Partly,” I said. “Yes. I need to decide what I want to do about my work. I don’t want to go on as I am. I don’t feel I ever change anything with my writing. I don’t even know if I want to live in New York anymore.” “Well, it’s certainly hard for me to think of you living in New York,” Zach said. “You look so at home on Rusty.” I smiled a little. “I am at home on Rusty,” I agreed. “I’m a country girl really.” Zach’s face was very close to mine. Close enough to kiss. Zach seemed to read my thoughts. He moved closer and then he did kiss me. As I started to kiss him back, I knew I didn’t want him to be with Mom. I wanted him to be with me . . . Mom! “No!” I said, and stood up. Zach looked at me. “I’m sorry, Alyssa,” he said. “That was wrong. You’re feeling sad. I shouldn’t . . .” “No,” I said. “You shouldn’t. We shouldn’t.” And I turned and walked out of the hide. Zach followed me, of course. “I’m sorry, Alyssa,” he said. “What else can I say?” I didn’t answer. I wasn’t very happy with myself. “Alyssa,” Zach said. “Please, just wait. Let’s talk about it.” “There’s nothing to say,” I told him. Zach moved to stand in front of me. “Well, I think there is,” he said. “You just told me something very important about your life. That means a lot. I didn’t mean to try and kiss you like that, but I suddenly felt so close to you and . . .” “The way you feel close to Mom?” I asked. “Well no, not at all,” he said, and then he looked at me. “Now, wait a minute,” he said. “You don’t still think . . .?” “I don’t know what to think, Zach,” I said. “All I know is that Mom was really mad at me when she knew I was coming here. She likes you. She really likes you.” “Oh,” said Zach. “And I . . . Well I’ve got a lot going on in my life at the moment. I don’t need to . . . to start anything with my mom’s boyfriend.” I moved around Zach and began to walk away. “How many times do I have to tell you?” Zach said. “I’m not your mom’s boyfriend!” “That’s what you say!” I said, still walking. “I say it because it’s true,” Zach said, coming after me. I was at my car now. I turned to look at Zach. “Well,” I said. “I think you better tell her that.” And I got in my car and drove away. As I made my way back to Mom’s, I felt tired and sad. Seeing the ocelots had been so special; they had been so beautiful. But I knew it hadn’t been a good idea to meet up with Zach. I had come to Texas to get away from my problems, and now I had another problem, a big one: Zach and the way I felt about him. A death When I stopped the car, I saw that there was a car outside Mom’s house. Mom had a visitor. “Great,” I thought, feeling tired. I just wanted to go to my room and go to bed. I didn’t want to have to speak to someone I didn’t know. But I did know Mom’s visitor; I knew him very well. “Tyler!” I said as I saw who was sitting next to Mom on the sofa. “What are you doing here?” Tyler stood up. “I had to talk to you, Alyssa,” he said. “I took some time off work and came out here.” He looked tired and unhappy, and I felt bad. “I’ll let you two talk,” Mom said, but before she could leave the room, there was the sound of a car outside. “Who can that be?” Mom asked, and went to look. Tyler was still looking at me with his big, sad eyes. “Alyssa,” he said, and he took me in his arms and kissed me. Immediately I thought about Zach and how it had felt when he had kissed me. And then suddenly I heard Zach, outside the house, speaking to Mom! Immediately I pulled away from Tyler. “I just wanted to see if Alyssa was OK,” I heard Zach say. “She had things on her mind when she drove away from my house.” “Alyssa?” Tyler asked me. “Who’s Zach?” I didn’t answer. I was too busy listening. “Alyssa’s OK,” Mom answered. “She’s in the house. With her boyfriend. They just got engaged, you know. They’re going to be married.” “Alyssa?” Tyler was asking again. “Who’s Zach? And what were you doing at his house?” “We were watching ocelots,” I told him quickly. I wanted to know what Zach would say. “Oh,” Zach said. “I see.” “No, Zach!” I thought. “You don’t see at all!” “Watching ocelots?” Tyler said. “Yes,” I said quickly. I was still listening. “Well,” Zach said. “As long as she’s OK . . .” “Let’s get out of here. We need to talk,” Tyler said and he led me from the room. When we met Mom and Zach outside, Zach looked at Tyler, then at me. “Are you OK, Alyssa?” he asked. “She’s fine,” Tyler said. His voice was angry. “Come on, Alyssa.” I didn’t want to go with him, but I knew he was right. We did need to talk. So I smiled at Zach and went with Tyler. When I was in the car, Tyler drove away quickly. “I’m not going to ask you about tonight, Alyssa,” he said. “I just want us to think about you and me. You and me and the life we can have together. We can have children, Alyssa, children and a lovely home. You can leave your job if you want to. I just want you to be happy, and I don’t want you to have to think about the bad things of this world anymore.” Listening to Tyler, I knew how much he loved me. But I also knew that the life he was talking about wasn’t what I wanted. Oh, I wanted to have children one day, but I wanted other things too. “Tyler,” I said softly, “you’re so good to me, and I know you want the best for me. But, I don’t think you really understand what I need.” “Yes, I do, Alyssa, I . . .” I held up my hand. “Please,” I said. “Let me finish.” “OK,” Tyler said. “Sorry.” I thought for a moment, trying to find the right words to explain. “It’s true that I’m unhappy at the moment. Writing the story of Emily’s death made me feel really sad. But, Tyler, I’m unhappy because I feel my writing doesn’t change anything, not because I want to stop writing! I want to do more about the bad things in the world, not less. I want to write stories people will remember all their lives!” Tyler was silent for a while, thinking about what I had said. “Can’t you do that and still be with me?” he asked. “No,” I told him sadly. “I don’t think I can.” Tyler was mad at me, suddenly. “Then why did you say ‘yes’ to me, Alyssa?” he asked. “If you don’t want the life I can give you, why did you agree to marry me?” I closed my eyes. “Tyler, I’m so sorry. I was feeling very sad when you asked me. I suppose I didn’t know what I wanted. It was nice to be loved so much. But now I’ve had time to think, and I know it would be wrong to marry you.” Tyler was about to say something else, but suddenly there was a loud sound outside the car. “We’ve hit something!” I said. “Tyler, we’ve hit an animal!” Tyler slowed the car down. “It will be dead, whatever it was,” he said. “It might be an ocelot!” I said, thinking about the mother ocelot and her babies. “We have to go and see.” Tyler still wasn’t stopping the car. “It’s too late,” he said. “You can’t do anything for it now. The same way you can’t help Emily. It’s too late.” I suddenly wanted to cry. I felt sad and really mad at the same time. “I can’t stop Emily being dead,” I said. “That’s true. But I can try to speak for her through my writing. I can try to speak for all the Emilys of this world! But right now, I just want you to stop this car!” Truth talking Finally Tyler did stop the car and I started to get out right away. “Do you want me to come with you?” Tyler asked, but I could tell he didn’t want to. He didn’t care about the dead animal at all. And suddenly I was very glad I had come to Texas. If I had stayed in New York, I might have married Tyler before I knew what I really wanted. “No,” I said. “It’s OK. I’ll be all right on my own. Good-bye, Tyler.” Tyler looked at me one last time. “Good-bye, Alyssa,” he said, and then I closed the car door and he drove away. It was dark without the lights from Tyler’s car. I started to walk back toward Mom’s house, looking at the side of the road for the animal. “Please don’t let it be an ocelot,” I thought. “Please.” A car was coming toward me. My clothes were dark, so I stood right at the side of the road to keep safe. I only realized it was Zach when the car stopped. He looked worried about me as he got out, and I wanted to run to him, to feel his arms around me. “Alyssa,” he said. “Where’s your boyfriend? Are you OK?” “Tyler’s gone,” I said, and I was almost crying. “And . . . and he’s not my boyfriend. Not now. Oh, Zach, he drove into an animal somewhere near here. I’m trying to find it. I’m so afraid it’s one of the ocelots!” “Try not to worry, Alyssa,” Zach told me kindly as we began to walk back along the road. I didn’t answer. I was too busy looking for the animal. Then, suddenly, I saw something. “Over there!” I said to Zach. “I think I can see something.” Zach went to look. “It’s a deer,” he told me. “Not an ocelot.” I went over to see. “Oh, yes,” I said. And then, as I looked at the dead animal, I did start to cry. This evening and these past few weeks, suddenly it was all too much. “Shh, Alyssa,” Zach said, and held me in his arms. “It’s OK.” I put my face against Zach’s warm body and for a while I couldn’t stop crying. Then I finally looked up at Zach. “I’m sorry,” I told him. “It isn’t nice to be happy that another animal is dead, and I’m not really. I’m just so pleased Tyler didn’t kill an ocelot.” A car went past. Zach began to lead me back along the road toward his car. “Come on,” he said. “Let’s get you back to your mom’s house.” As Zach drove, I looked at him. He was a good man, and suddenly I knew he had been telling me the truth about him and Mom. I felt sad for her, and I hoped things would be OK between us all in the future. The future! What would my future hold now? I had made a decision about Tyler tonight, but I still had other important things to make decisions about. But there was time. I didn’t need to hurry into anything. “I want you to know something,” I said to Zach. Zach kept his eyes on the road. “What’s that?” he asked. “I told Tyler I didn’t want to marry him yesterday, before I came to meet you. He didn’t want to accept it, that’s why he came to see me tonight.” “You don’t have to explain it all to me, Alyssa,” Zach said. “I want to,” I told him. “I’m not someone who kisses a man behind her boyfriend’s back. I want you to know that.” Zach turned the car toward Mom’s house. He smiled at me quickly. “I think it was I who kissed you,” he said. My face went red. “Yes,” I agreed. “But I kissed you back. And . . . and it was a very nice kiss.” Zach stopped the car outside Mom’s house. He turned to look at me. “Yes,” he agreed. “It was. A very nice kiss.” He was looking at my mouth. “I . . . I only stopped it because of Mom,” I told him. Zach took my hand in his. “I spoke to your mom,” he told me. “After you went off with Tyler tonight. I told her I only see her as a friend. I said I was very sorry if I gave her any other idea.” I felt bad for Mom, and I looked at Zach. “Oh,” I said. “Is she OK?” “She was a little sad,” he told me. “I don’t think she wants to see me for a while.” “Oh,” I said again. “I think she’ll be OK,” Zach said. “If we give it time.” If we give it time. I knew Zach was talking about us—him and me, and I was suddenly very happy. But before I could say anything, a car drove up behind us. Zach and I both looked round as the car door opened and someone got out. For a moment I thought it was Tyler come back again, but then Zach began to smile. A traveler returns “Dad!” Zach said and threw open the car door. I got out too, and when I walked round the front of the car, I saw Zach and a tall, white-haired man together. I remembered his face from the painting on Mom’s wall. It was Zach’s father. “Mr Anderson!” I said. “You’re back!” Mike Anderson came over to me. “Alyssa,” he said. “Good to see you. Yes, I’m back, only to find someone’s put a gate across my ranch. I can’t get in!” “I can explain, Dad,” Zach started to say, but before he could finish, Mom came out of the house behind us. “Mike!” she shouted. “It’s so great to see you!” Mike Anderson smiled. “Caroline,” he said. “It’s good to see you too.” They stood there, smiling at each other, and something made me think about the painting Mom had. Maybe it wasn’t just the painting Mom liked. Maybe Mom liked Mike too. Well, he was a very nice, very good-looking man. “Did you have a great time overseas? Where did you get to in the end? Oh, I can’t wait to hear about it all!” Mom was speaking quickly, and all the time she was smiling and looking up into Mike’s face. Yes, maybe she did like Mike. Then I had another idea. Maybe Mom had liked Zach because he made her think about his father . . . We went inside shortly after that, the four of us. Mom made some coffee, and we sat and listened to Mike as he talked about his time away. Mom was on the sofa next to him. They looked good together. When Zach gave me a little smile, I knew he was thinking the same thing. “How lovely to see all those places!” Mom said. “I haven’t finished yet,” Mike told her, and then he looked at Zach. “If it’s OK with you, Zach, if you’re OK looking after the ranch, I want to see some more countries. I was thinking about Australia.” “Of course, Dad,” Zach started to say, but Mom was speaking too. “Australia! How wonderful! I must show you how to paint before you go. You could paint the red center of the country! I’ve always wanted to do that.” Mike Anderson looked at her. “Well, why don’t you?” he asked. “Come with me. We can travel together.” Mom put a hand to her face. She was smiling like a child with a new toy. “I couldn’t,” she said. “Could I?” “Well, why not?” Mike said, and Mom started to laugh. “Well then,” she said. “Yes! I’ll do it! I’ll come to Australia!” As she and Mike sat on the sofa laughing together, Zach smiled at me again, and suddenly we both started to laugh. Then we were all laughing. And suddenly I had real hope for the future. I didn’t know yet if I was going to leave my job. I didn’t know if I was going to live in New York or back here in Texas. But there was one thing I was sure about. I wanted Zach in my life. And I knew a way to make sure I saw him often. “Zach,” I said, “while our parents are off having a good time in Australia, can I help you with the ocelot festival?” He smiled at me. “Of course,” he said. “That’s a great idea. You could write something for us, get everyone interested. Look, why don’t we go back to the ranch to talk about it? These two need to make their plans anyway.” “Good idea,” I said, and I stood up. Then I looked at Mom. “If that’s OK with you, Mom?” I asked. Mom smiled at me. Then she got up and came over to kiss me. “Yes, Alyssa,” she said. “That’s OK with me. It’s quite OK.” I smiled and kissed her back. I knew she was saying that she was OK about Zach and me now. I looked over at him. “Coming?” I asked.

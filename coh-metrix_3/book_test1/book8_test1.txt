“You’re beautiful!” “Yes!” called Estela as she came off the field. “Good win, everybody.” The soccer game was finished and Captain Estela Ramos and her team were the winners. “Great game!” she said to the young women on the team. They were tired, but very happy. Estela was the captain of the team and a very good player. “You were very good!” she said. “You too, Estela!” said her friend Katy. “Ah, I was OK,” she said. It wasn’t her best game ever, she knew, but the team won so she wasn’t worried about that. Estela smiled at her friend. Then she walked to Coach George Gray. “So, how was that?” she asked, smiling. “Hmm. Not bad,” said the coach. They walked back to the locker rooms. “Not bad!?” said Estela. “We just won the cup! Did you see it?” The coach was never happy, she thought. It was a great win against Tacoma College, a very good team. “The girls worked really well together,” she said, a little angry. “We did OK, didn’t we?” “Well,” he said, “the team won, yes, but you didn’t play well, Estela. You missed a lot of opportunities. And your passing—we must work on your passing. I need more from you . . .” Coach Gray went on for some minutes. “Didn’t I do anything right?” she asked when he finished. Her face was red now. She knew he was right, and that made it even worse. The coach didn’t speak. He seemed to be thinking about that. “Aaghh!” she said. She ran away from Coach Gray and into the locker room. In the locker room, Estela was really angry. We won, she thought. Why can’t he say something nice? The other girls were happy, and Estela tried to look happy, too. She tried to forget about the coach. “We’re going to eat at Ben’s, Estela,” said Katy. “Coming?” “No,” she said, “not now. Maybe I’ll come later.” “OK,” said Katy. Then she and the other girls went to the café. Five minutes later, Estela came out of the locker room. She didn’t want to see Coach Gray again. Gray wasn’t there, but when she came out of the door of the locker room, Estela saw a man about thirty years old with black hair. He wore a very smart dark blue suit and tie. The suit looked expensive, she thought. He was very good-looking. “Miss Ramos?” said the man. “Yes?” said Estela. “My name is Aldo Rossi,” said the man as he gave her his hand. “I am in the USA on business and I came here to see my sister, Carla, play. She plays for Tacoma College.” “Oh, yes.” Estela said. “Carla Rossi! I know Carla.” Estela played against Carla often and knew her well. She was a nice young woman. “She’s a good player,” she said. “Yes,” said the man. “When I visit the USA from Italy, I always try to watch one of her games.” Italian. He looked Italian, thought Estela, and when he spoke English, he sounded Italian, too. He had a beautiful voice. “That’s nice,” she said. “Yes. You . . . your team were very good,” he said. Suddenly, his face was serious. “Can I ask you about something, Miss Ramos?” Estela looked at Aldo Rossi. “Sure,” she said. “First, let me tell you something about myself. I live and work in the city of Milan,” he went on. “Maybe you know something about Milan?” “Milan?” said Estela. “Well, I know you have two great soccer teams.” Rossi laughed. “That’s right. But do you know anything about fashion?” “Well, not really. I know Milan is important for fashion . . .” “Estela, Milan is fashion,” he went on. “And I work in the fashion business—for my family’s fashion house, the House of Rossi. My father, Franco Rossi, is the head of the House.” “Oh, really? That sounds exciting,” said Estela. “What do you do?” “I look for models,” he said. “I look for beautiful women and beautiful men . . .” He laughed. “It’s a great job!” “OK . . .” Where’s this going? Estela thought. “I watched the game today,” said Rossi, smiling a very nice smile, “but there was only one player for me—you. You are a good soccer player, Estela. But you are also very beautiful. Very, very beautiful!” “Well, I . . .” Estela’s face went red, but it was good to hear something nice. “Did you ever think about modeling?” he asked. Modeling? Estela didn’t know what to say. Her dream was to become a soccer player, not a model. Aldo Rossi took a small card from his jacket pocket. “This is my card,” he said. “Why don’t you come and see our studio in Seattle with Carla?” Estela wasn’t sure. Rossi was nice and she knew his sister. But modeling? “I don’t know,” she said. “Please think about it. Maybe you’ll like it!” he said smiling again. Estela smiled back. Maybe I will, she thought. The man from Milan The next day, Carla Rossi called Estela. “Aldo told me everything,” Carla said. “I think it’s great. Why don’t you come with me to visit him today?” “I’m not sure,” Estela began. “Come on!” said Carla. “It’ll be fun.” Later that day, the two young women went into Seattle to see Aldo. Carla talked about her family and her older brother as they went by train into the city. “I know he’s my brother,” she smiled, “but he’s really nice.” In the city, they went to the studio. Aldo was there. “I just want to watch,” Estela said. “No, no, no!” said Aldo, laughing. He showed her a beautiful dress. “Try this on.” Estela tried on the dress. Then, with a red face, she walked up and down a special stage that models walk on, called a “runway.” A photographer took some photographs of her. A lot of photographs. “I can’t believe this. It’s like being on TV or something!” Estela laughed. “Very good!” said Aldo Rossi. “You are very good at this!” Aldo and Carla were very kind to her. The photographer was nice, too. It’s so nice that they like what I’m doing, she thought. At the end of the day, Aldo said, “I want to show these photographs to some people. I may have a job for you next week. Are you free next week?” We have a game next week, Estela said to herself. Then she thought about George Gray. “Maybe,” she said. “Good,” said Rossi. “I’ll call you.” Later, Estela saw her friend Katy. The two girls sat in Ben’s Café together. They drank coffee and talked. “What!?” said Katy. “That’s so exciting!” Katy was a short young woman with blonde hair. Now she had a very big smile on her face. “Well, maybe,” said Estela. “I’m sure nothing will happen.” “Estela!” said Katy. “You don’t know. He might ask you to go to a fashion show. Maybe he’ll want you to go to Milan!” “Slow down, Katy,” she said to her friend, laughing. “Nobody’s asking me to go to Milan, or anywhere. They just took some photos of me. Anyway, we have a game next week.” “But how can you think about soccer?” asked Katy as she drank her coffee. They talked some more. Then they went to “The Pit,” the college’s movie theater, to see a new movie. As soon as Estela came out of the movies, she looked at her cell phone. She saw there were no messages. “Looking for a message from Signor Aldo?” smiled Katy. “Katy!” Just then, Estela’s cell phone rang. She looked at the number. “It’s him!” said Estela. “It’s Rossi!” “Answer it,” said Katy. Rossi spoke to Estela over the phone. Estela listened quietly. “Can I call you back? Thank you,” she said. Her face was white. “What, Estela?” Katy asked. “Oh, tell me, come on!” “That was Aldo Rossi,” she said. “He wants me to go to Milan next week!” Estela thought about what to do all the next day. Milan! She couldn’t believe it. In Estela’s world, Italian men didn’t call and ask you to go to Milan. She heard Rossi ask her, but she still couldn’t quite believe it. She didn’t know what to do. It was true that there was a week’s break from college next week, but the soccer team had a game on the weekend. Oh, what can I do? she thought. That night, she called her mother. “I can travel to Italy with Carla, his sister,” she said. “She’s going home for the break . . .” “But darling, that’s wonderful!” said Belinda Ramos. “A model! That’s much better than soccer for a beautiful girl like you. Maybe you can find a nice young man!” Estela wasn’t surprised that her mother was happy. Both her mother and father only wanted her to find a rich husband and to give them grandchildren. They didn’t like soccer that much. “You must go, Estela,” said her mother. “This is a wonderful opportunity for you to see Europe! Ah, when I was young . . .” Belinda Ramos told her daughter about a trip to Europe when she was a girl. Her mother stopped talking. Estela put the phone down and lay on her bed. What about the game? she thought. What will Coach Gray say? She started to phone his number, but then she put the phone down. Why phone him? she thought. He always says something bad about me! I’ll send him an e-mail. She picked up the phone again and took Aldo Rossi’s card from her table. “Mr. Rossi?” she said. “This is Estela Ramos. I’ll come. I’ll come to Milan!” A week later, Estela was in the Duomo Hotel in Milan. She looked around her room. It was like a dream, she thought. An hour after she arrived, Aldo Rossi phoned her. “Welcome to Milan, Estela,” he said. “My sister tells me you had a good trip. How’s your room?” “Beautiful!” said Estela. She looked around the large room with its views of the city. It really was lovely. “Good!” said Rossi. “I told them to give you a nice room. I’m coming now . . . to take you to dinner.” ”OK,” she said. “Give me thirty minutes.” Estela got out of bed quickly and took a shower. In the shower, she smiled as she thought about the trip from Seattle to Milan. It was so nice in the business class of the plane. She had a good time with Carla Rossi; they talked a lot. Then Carla took a taxi to her family’s home, and Estela came to this great hotel. It was all very exciting, she thought, as she got out of the shower and started to get dressed. Twenty minutes later, Estela was dressed and in the hotel lobby. Aldo Rossi was there. “You look beautiful, Estela!” said Rossi. “Really beautiful!” He kissed her on both cheeks. Very Italian, thought Estela. Estela wore her favorite red dress. And Aldo Rossi looked good, too, she thought. He wore a black suit, a pink shirt, and a thin black tie. When they walked into La Terrazza restaurant, everybody looked. “How do you feel?” asked Rossi. “Good,” said Estela, smiling. “A little worried, maybe . . .” “About tomorrow?” Rossi asked. Estela had to start her “runway training” the next day. “Well, yes,” she said. “Don’t worry, Estela,” said Rossi. “It’s going to be easy for you. All you need to do is walk up and down the runway and smile.” He gave her a big smile. Estela looked at Aldo Rossi. She liked the way he said her name. Est-eeela. He made it sound very long and very beautiful. Aldo was a very nice man, she thought, and very good- looking. He was different from the boys at Brenton College. He was very kind. Yes, she thought, she liked him very much. Wait a minute, she thought. You only met him last week. That was true. But everything was happening so fast . . . The runway The next day, Tuesday, Estela started her runway training. She only had three days—the opening night of the show was on Friday. She worked with a young man called Gianni. Gianni worked for the House of Rossi. He gave her some beautiful clothes and shoes to wear. She had to practice walking down the runway in the clothes. But the problem wasn’t the clothes. It was the shoes. Estela usually wore sneakers, so she found it hard to walk up and down the runway. She didn’t usually walk in that way, and she knew that she didn’t do it right. But Gianni was happy. “That’s great, Estela,” he called. “You look great!!” Estela went back and came down the runway in some different clothes. Gianni called as she started her walk down the runway, “You are a beautiful model, Estela, the most beautiful model in the world. Hold up your head! That’s right . . .” Estela walked on. She looked at the runway. It’s very narrow, she thought. Do models ever fall? “The world’s looking at you, Estela!” Gianni continued. “Can you feel them? Can you feel their eyes?” Estela wanted to laugh. What’s he talking about? she thought, but she didn’t say it. She just continued walking up and down the runway. This is getting easy, she thought. After a while she started to think about the soccer game on the weekend. They were playing Washington State College—a very good team. Their number seven was very good—Estela wanted to tell Coach Gray about her, too . . . Suddenly Estela felt herself falling. She dropped off the runway and hit the ground with an “oof!” What happened? she asked herself. Gianni ran to her and helped her to get up. “Are you all right?” he asked. “I’m . . . I’m sorry,” she said to Gianni. She felt a little strange. “Did you hit your head?” he asked. “No. Well, maybe. I think I’m OK.” “Why don’t you sit down?” Estela sat down for a moment. Gianni gave her a cup of coffee. Come on, Estela, she said to herself. Think! . . . Think about what you’re doing, just like you do when you play soccer! After that, Estela worked very hard for three days. She didn’t fall again. As she did the training, she learned that it was more difficult than she had thought. She saw that she made many mistakes. But Gianni and the others seemed happy with her. They’re so nice to me, she thought, but I know I’m not very good. When she stopped working, she went to see the city alone, or with Carla Rossi. Carla took her shopping down the famous shopping streets like the Via Manzoni. The fashions really were beautiful! She looked at the old churches and other buildings. When she got back to her hotel, she was usually tired, but happy. It was Estela’s first time in Europe and she was very excited. On Friday morning, Gianni told Aldo she was ready. “Good!” said Aldo Rossi, smiling at Estela. “Brava, Estela!” Estela looked at the good-looking Italian. She wanted to be good tonight. She liked Aldo Rossi. Does he like me, too? she asked herself. That night was the opening night. The show started at eight o’clock. Behind the runway, all the models got ready. Carla was there, too. Everyone was very excited. The clothes were beautiful, and everyone wanted to do a good job. Estela was excited and a little worried. What if I fall again? she asked herself. She tried not to think about it. Out in front, there were lots of people. The whole Rossi family was there. People from the newspapers were there. Lots of famous people were there to see the show. There were singers, film actors, and even soccer players. “Someone’s saying that Dino Zanetti’s here!” said one of the models to Estela. Dino Zanetti, thought Estela. Zanetti was one of the world’s great soccer players. He played for Inter-Milan until a few years ago. He was a very famous player. Maybe too famous. Many people thought his fame became more important than soccer to him, and he started to play badly. Now he didn’t play at all. The show started. Estela had to wait. She was fourth. It was just twenty minutes, but it felt like twenty hours. Estela felt sick, even sicker than before a game. The other girls went out and came back. How do they do it? Estela thought. She waited and waited. Then, it was her turn! She went out onto the runway and started to walk down it. Her legs didn’t feel strong as she started to walk. She saw lights and hundreds of people. She walked on. Her first clothes were a black dress and red shoes. “She’s beautiful!” people said. “What a great dress!” But Estela didn’t feel beautiful. She didn’t think that she looked good, and she still felt sick. She tried to smile. Then she went back and got changed. When she came back out, she wore white pants and a blue blouse. I look terrible, Estela said to herself. She walked down the runway, but it was difficult to walk in the shoes that she wore. She thought about falling again. Stop it, Estela, she told herself. Concentrate! “Bella! What a pretty girl!” people said. Estela came out onto the runway seven times. She didn’t feel that she was very good, but each time everyone said nice things about her. After an hour and a half, the show was finished. Estela was happy it was finished. She changed and went to the front. There was a party for everyone. “You were great!!” Aldo Rossi came to Estela and kissed her on both cheeks. “Beautiful, Estela!” said Carla. “Brava! Good job, young lady!” said Franco Rossi. He was Aldo and Carla’s father, and the head of the House of Rossi. Estela was surprised. She felt very bad, but everyone thought she was great! Then Aldo Rossi said to her, “Estela, why don’t you come and talk to Dino Zanetti?” Rossi pulled her toward a group of people. Suddenly she saw Zanetti. There were people and cameras all around him. I can’t believe it, she thought. He’s only 32, but he looks like he’s over 40. Zanetti was no longer the healthy, slim young man who scored more goals than anyone at Inter-Milan soccer team. “Dino, I’d like you to meet Estela Ramos, one of our new models. Estela, this is Dino Zanetti,” said Rossi. He gave a big smile. “Estela likes soccer,” he said to the ex-Milan player. “She’s a good player, too . . .” “Really?” Dino Zanetti turned toward Estela and looked at her. “A beautiful woman like you, playing soccer?” “Umm . . . yes,” Estela said. She smiled. “Anyway, you looked very pretty tonight!” said Zanetti. The other players around him agreed. Zanetti was only 32, thought Estela, but he no longer played soccer. When he was young he was great—like Pele or Maradona. But now he made money from being famous and going on TV. It made her feel sad. He was a great player who lost his dream, she thought. At the party, Estela met a lot more famous people. Later, Aldo Rossi took Estela out to dinner at another expensive restaurant. They sat down near the window and ordered the food. “You did a very good job tonight, Estela,” Rossi said. “Thank you,” she smiled. “Did you have a good time?” he asked. “Yes . . .” she said. “But . . .” “You can do this all the time, Estela,” he said. “What do you mean?” “Come and work for us. As a model. Travel all over the world, to New York, Paris, London.” “But I’m at college,” said Estela. “And the soccer team . . . I thought it was just this trip to Milan!” Aldo Rossi took Estela’s hands in his. “Please think about it, Estela. I really hope that you will do it.” He looked into Estela’s eyes. “I hope so . . . because I have a very special feeling for you . . .” “I . . .” “Shh . . .” said Rossi. He put his finger on Estela’s lips. Then, Aldo Rossi came close to Estela and kissed her. The world of fashion The rest of the week passed very quickly for Estela. Every day, there were shows, and she had to walk up and down the runway. It got easier for her, but she didn’t feel that she was very good at being a model. Still, she didn’t fall, and everyone was always nice to her, always saying she was beautiful. There were also parties and people to meet. One evening, Aldo and Carla took her to La Scala, the famous opera house. It was great! The show on the last night went well. After the show, Aldo said, “Estela! You were great, as usual. Remember, it’s the last night party tonight. I’ll come to the hotel at nine o’clock.” Estela felt a little tired. Was every night a party in the fashion world? But she smiled and said OK. She went back to the hotel to get ready. In her room, she saw that there were messages from Katy and the others. The game! It was the game today, she thought. She looked at Katy’s message. It had only two words: We lost. Estela quickly set up her computer and called Katy. “Hey, Estela! How’s Europe?” asked Katy. It was good to hear her friend’s voice. “It’s OK. It’s good,” Estela said. “What happened in the game?” “2-1,” said Katy. She laughed. “We missed you!” They talked about the game. “But you’ll be back next week,” said Katy. “We’ll win for sure.” Estela thought about Aldo. But will I be back next week? Aldo came to the hotel at nine o’clock. They went to the party at the Rossi’s beautiful big house—their villa—on Lake Como, about an hour from Milan. It was the last night of the show, and the party was a big one. There were a lot of famous people there. “You will make a lot of money, young lady,” said Franco Rossi. Estela smiled. Do I want to make a lot of money? she asked herself. Money wasn’t a bad thing, but it wasn’t very important to her. Estela smiled at people when they said nice things to her, but as the evening went on, she became very bored. She saw Dino Zanetti sitting at a table and went to talk to him. “Hello, Mr. Zanetti. Are you enjoying the party?” “Hello, beautiful,” he replied, “what’s your name?” “I’m Estela. We met earlier this week at the fashion show.” “Of course. Of course.” He smiled, but she saw he didn’t remember her Suddenly, Estela felt very sad. She went outside and sat down. He doesn’t know me, she thought. Everybody here tells me I’m great. Everybody tells me I’m beautiful. But nobody knows me at all. They don’t care about me. They just want me to be beautiful. She thought about Coach Gray. He was hard on her, but that was because he wanted her to be really good. He cared about her, she thought. Coach Gray knows that I have to work very hard, she thought, to play for the U.S. team. She looked over at Dino Zanetti again. He lost his dream and he didn’t play soccer anymore. Why? she asked herself. Because of all this? Because everyone told him he was great all the time? She liked Milan. She liked the modeling. But she loved soccer, she realized. She loved it because of the game, not because of other people. And she was good at it. Maybe she was great. Being a model—well, it was fun, and this trip was very exciting. But it wasn’t real. It isn’t what I want! she said to herself. I want to play soccer! Suddenly, she knew. This is not for me, she thought. This world . . . these people . . . they’re not for me. I have to go home. I have to tell Aldo, she thought. Where was he? Estela looked around. She thought about him. She thought about their kiss. At least the kiss was real, she thought. Wasn’t it? The beautiful game Estela looked around the room, but Aldo wasn’t there. She went through the door and into the next room. Where was he? She looked around, but he wasn’t anywhere. Then she saw him. He was with one of the other models, a tall young woman with long blonde hair. They were kissing! Well, this makes everything easier, Estela thought. Aldo saw Estela, and his face went red. “Estela . . . I . . .” He walked across the room to talk to her. Estela laughed. “It’s OK, Aldo,” she said. “Really, it’s OK. I want to say thank you.” “What do you mean?” he asked. “I just want to tell you that I’m going back home tomorrow,” she went on. “And to say thank you. Thank you for everything.” “I . . . What? Because of this? Estela, please.” Estela laughed again, “No, not because of this. I just made a decision. This life—modeling, fashion, all these parties—it’s not for me. I want to go back.” “I don’t understand, Estela,” he said. “How can you do this? How can you not take this opportunity? This is every woman’s dream!” “Maybe it is,” she smiled. “This week was like a dream. I enjoyed every minute of it. Milan, the fashion show, everything. It was great! But . . . it’s not what I want. I want to play soccer.” Aldo looked at her. He was thinking about something. “You know, Estela, I am different from most Italian men. You know why?” “Because you’re . . . I don’t know.” “Because I don’t like soccer. I go to see Carla play because she’s my sister. But soccer? For me, it’s boring. Many people call it ’The Beautiful Game.’ I didn’t understand this . . . But last week, when I saw you play . . . Now I understand it. When you play, it really is the beautiful game.” Estela smiled at him and kissed him on the cheek. “Thank you,” she said, “for everything.” “Good luck, Estela.” Then Estela said good-bye and went back to her hotel. The next day, Estela went to the airport and got on the afternoon flight from Milan to New York, then on to Seattle. She sat in the plane and thought about her trip. What an exciting trip, she thought. She had lots of things to talk about, to her friends at Brenton College and to her family, and to the girls on the team. She thought about next week’s soccer game. We’ll win for sure, Katy said. Estela closed her eyes and she saw herself, playing in the next game. She saw herself running past the other players and Katy passing the ball to her. Then she saw herself scoring. She thought about it again and again, all the way back home.

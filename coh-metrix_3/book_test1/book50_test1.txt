Introduction Emotions are important to our lives. They make our lives better. We feel happy on a sunny day. We feel love for our family and friends. We feel excited when we visit a new place. Emotions can also keep us safe. For example, we stay away from a snake because it makes us feel scared. Often, emotions help us to make good decisions. However, emotions can make us feel unhappy, too. Sometimes, we may not be able to control them. For example, we may shout at a friend because we are angry. Then, we may lose that friend. We may look nervous when giving a presentation at work or school. Then, people may not listen to our ideas. We may not be able to stay calm. Then, we cannot talk to our boss or teacher about something important. We may not be able to control how we feel sometimes. But, we can make sure our feelings do not control us. We can try new ways of thinking. Or, we can do things to help us control our feelings. Now, stop and think for a moment. Think about what your life would be like if you could handle your feelings. How would your life change if you didn’t let your feelings control what you said or what you did? What if you could stay calm even when you felt angry? Let’s look at ten ways that you can do this: 1. Learn to understand your emotions We cannot take care of a problem unless we know what it is. To learn how to handle your emotions, you have to first understand what they are. When you feel upset, learn to stop and think about how you are feeling. Try to understand the emotion. Are you angry? Are you sad? Are you disappointed? Are you nervous? Find out exactly what emotion you are feeling. Sometimes, we think we feel one way. But really, we feel another way. For example, you score badly on a test. Do you feel disappointed because you did your best? Or, do you feel angry at yourself because you didn’t study enough? Maybe, you feel scared because your parents, teacher, or boss will be angry with you. Think deeply about the real reason. Also, think about why you lost control of your emotions. Sometimes, there is a deeper reason. Your partner leaves their dirty socks on the floor. So, you got very angry. Did you really get angry because your partner is messy? Or, did you really get angry because your partner doesn’t help you to keep the house clean? Maybe, you need to ask your partner for help instead of shouting at them about the dirty socks. 2. Think about times you didn’t handle your emotions well We want to handle our emotions well. So, we need to think about times in the past when we didn’t. It may be difficult to do so. But, it can help us to change. We may feel regret after we lose control and shout at someone. We understand that we hurt that person with our words. Often, they feel bad and we feel bad. Do you want to stop feeling regret after you become angry at someone? Have you ever lost a job opportunity because you didn’t handle your emotions well? Did people not want to work with you because you got angry easily? Did people not listen to your ideas because you looked nervous? Was it difficult to talk about your ideas at work or in a presentation because you were nervous? Maybe, you wanted to stand up for yourself, but you felt like you were going to cry. Instead, you chose to stay quiet. We can’t do our best if we can’t control our emotions. We can’t say the ideas we want to share. We can’t have the relationships we want to have. And, we can’t be the person we want to be. We have to think back to times we lost control. We must learn from regret and we must change. 3. Imagine happy endings Go back and think about the times you didn’t handle your emotions well. What could you have done differently? Imagine a different ending. Imagine you handled your emotions well. Imagine everything worked out. Imagine a happy ending. Instead of getting angry at someone, you stayed calm. You explained how you felt. The other person understood how you felt. The other person wanted to work with you. The other person wanted to be your friend. You both felt good. Instead of feeling nervous while talking about your ideas or giving a presentation, you talked in a clear, calm voice. People listened to you. They heard your ideas. You felt good that they listened to you. Instead of not standing up for yourself, you calmly said what you wanted to say. Instead of feeling like you were going to cry, you talked calmly to the other person. Some things changed for the better. Some things did not. But, you are happy that you didn’t stay quiet. To help control our emotions, we can imagine an ending where we didn’t feel regret. We stayed calm. We controlled our emotions. This time we didn’t upset other people. This time we felt good. And, they felt good. 4. Take care of your health Imagine a situation in which you didn’t sleep well the night before. You are working too hard. You don’t have time to eat three healthy meals a day. You are too busy. You have lots of stress because your work is difficult. You start to feel sick. You feel like you are catching a cold. Situations in which you don’t feel well and feel lots of stress can be dangerous. At these times, it can be more difficult to handle your emotions. It can be more difficult because you don’t feel well. You can get upset or angry more easily. This is because you feel sick, tired, or stressed. So, make sure you get enough sleep. Try to eat good food. Take care of your health. Find ways to control your stress. If you do so, it will be easier to take care of difficult situations. It will be easier to handle your emotions. You won’t get upset if things go wrong. And, you won’t get so angry. You can control your emotions if someone is not nice to you. 5. Control the situation Think about the times you lose control of your emotions. Do you get angry at other drivers when driving? Do you get angry because you will be late? Do you get angry on the train when somebody pushes you? Is there someone at work that often does or says something that upsets you? Is it difficult to be nice to people at the end of the day? How about when you are hungry, and you just want to go home from work or school? We can control these situations. We can do things to make sure we can handle our emotions at these times. You know you always get angry when you are driving to work and will be late. So, leave the house a little earlier. You know you get angry on a busy train. So, get an earlier train. You know somebody at work or school upsets you. So, try to avoid that person. Or, plan what you will say to that person. You know you have trouble being nice to people when you are hungry. So, have an afternoon snack. Don’t let how you feel in these situations control you. If you plan ahead, you can be in control of these situations. And, you can control your emotions. 6. Don’t have high expectations You studied hard for a test. But, you feel very sad when you don’t get a good score. You go to a party. You think it will be great. But, you feel like leaving early because you said something and upset someone. You go on a trip. But, you get angry because your flight is late. You get angry because the hotel room is small. In each of these situations, you had high expectations. Sometimes, we have high expectations. And som times, things can go wrong. Then, it can be hard for us to handle our emotions. Life never works out as we expect it to. We should expect problems to happen. We should not care too much if we make mistakes. We should expect to get a few wrong answers on a test. We should expect that once in a while that we will upset someone. Or, that they will upset us. We should expect that things will go wrong from time to time when we go on trips. So, we shouldn’t get angry or sad. Learn to laugh or smile at each problem. That way, you can control your emotions easily. 7. Don’t make a situation bigger than it is We may feel out of control if we make a situation bigger than it really is. For example, imagine you make a mistake at work or school. Your boss or teacher gets angry and shouts at you for making the mistake. You think that you will lose your job over this mistake. Or, you start to imagine you will fail your course. You become worried and stressed. You imagine you won’t have enough money after you lose your job. You imagine you won’t graduate from school. When you go home, you shout at your family. Your family becomes angry at you. You cannot sleep that night because you are so upset. Then, you go to work the next day. Your boss says, “Hello” to you and smiles. You go to school. Your teacher says, “Great job on the homework.” They don’t remember the mistake you made yesterday! You worried about something that did not happen. We all have bad situations in our lives. We may feel scared because we are worrying and not thinking calmly. And, this can cause even more problems for us. We must think calmly about how we can make the situation better. We must not worry and make the situation bigger than it really is. 8. Write it down Write down your problems. It is the best way to not let your emotions make situations bigger than they are. It helps you to look at your problems calmly. It helps you to focus. It also helps you to understand more. It helps you to know when you are worrying or feeling stressed about things that may never happen. Take a piece of paper. Write down exactly what happened in the bad situation. Then, write what you imagine would be the worst thing to happen. At this point, you will see that the worst thing probably won’t happen. You will see that things aren’t as bad as you think they are. Sitting down and writing about the problem slows down our brains. It often helps us to find a new way to make the problem go away. Now, write down what you can do to make the situation better. Also, write down some ideas about what might happen next. Doing this will help you feel like you are more in control. Remember what the famous writer Mark Twain said about worrying. He said, “I’ve had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened.” 9. Listen to your body Sometimes, we may not be able to handle our emotions because we don’t understand when we are losing control. Our bodies often tell us when we are losing control. We should try to understand and listen to our bodies. Then, we can do things to take control. Do you feel you have butterflies in your stomach? Maybe, you feel nervous. Take deep, slow breaths. Imagine the butterflies are leaving your stomach each time you breathe. Is your heart beating fast? Maybe, you are stressed or angry. Again, take deep, slow breaths. Imagine the stress is an ugly color. Imagine that your feeling of being angry is an ugly color. When you breathe out, imagine you are breathing out that ugly color. Imagine you are breathing in a beautiful color. Do you feel your face or shoulders getting tight? Are you making fists? Is your face getting red and hot? Tell the other person, “Sorry, I need a moment.” Then, walk away until you feel calm again. Know when your body is telling you that you will lose control. It can help you to handle your emotions better. 10. Forgive yourself You have tried the first nine ways. Now, you are much better about handling your emotions. You feel good about yourself. However, one day there is a bad situation and you lose control of your emotions. You feel bad about yourself again. It is a good idea to keep a diary. Write down every day or a few times a week about your life. Write about how you feel. When you have a bad day and lose control of your emotions, go back and read the diary. Remember what you were like when you first started trying to control your emotions. You will see that you have gotten much better at handling them. It will make you feel better. It will make you want to keep trying to control them. Remember, we are all human. We all have feelings. Our emotions often make us feel good. They help us make good decisions. And now that we can handle our emotions well, our lives will be even better. Summary Now that you have read the book, stop and think again. Do you think these ten ways can help you to control your emotions? Do you think you can learn to understand your emotions? Can you think about times you didn’t handle your emotions well? Can you think about how to make that situation have a happier ending? Can you take care of yourself and your health? Can you think ahead so you can control the situation? Can you try not to lose control of your emotions? Is it possible to not always have such high expectations? Do you think you can learn not to make a situation bigger than it is? Will you take the time to sit and write about situations that upset you? Will you learn to listen to your body and calm yourself down? And finally, will you be able to forgive yourself if you do lose control of your emotions? Remember, emotions can make our lives better, but they can also cause us many problems. You don’t have to live a life where your emotions control you and make things difficult. Instead, you can live a good life where you are always in control of your emotions.

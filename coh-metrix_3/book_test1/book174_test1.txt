Introduction Think of people who can directly tell others what they think. They only take on work they want to do. They calmly talk with other people. They are confident. People listen carefully when they talk. They speak up when they think something needs to change. They also respect how other people feel. So, other people like to work with them. These kinds of people are assertive. For some people, being assertive feels natural. For the rest of us, being assertive is difficult. However, learning to be more assertive can make your life a lot better. You will have less stress. You can say what you feel without making other people angry or sad. You won’t agree to jobs you don’t want to do. Your relationships with other people will improve. You can enjoy your time at work or school more. You will be happier with your life. Learning to be assertive will take time. It will take effort. You will need to practice. However, as time goes by, it will become more natural. Now, stop and think for a moment about your life. Think about what it would be like if you were more assertive. How would your life change if you could speak up for yourself more? What if you could calmly and directly tell others how you feel? Let’s look at ten ways that you can do this: 1. Make a list of good things that will happen if you are assertive We might feel scared to be more assertive at first. Sometimes, it is easier to just stay quiet. It is easier to not say anything. However, not saying anything may make us unhappy. Staying quiet may not make things better. Why do you want to be more assertive? Make a list of reasons. List small reasons and big reasons. Don’t just write, “I want to be more assertive with my boss.” Don’t just write, “I want to be more assertive with my family and friends.” Write exactly what you want to happen. For example, “I want to tell my boss I can’t do work on the weekend, so I can have more free time.” Or, “I want to ask my mother to stop asking me when I’m going to get married. It always makes me feel bad.” Or, “I want to ask my friends to listen to me. Sometimes, I want them to do what I want to do – not what they want to do.” Don’t show this list to anyone. Keep it somewhere you can easily look at it. Read it often. This list will help you to remember why you want to try to be more assertive. 2. Think about times when you wanted to be more assertive Remember a time when you wanted to be more assertive. Think about how you felt at that time. Think about what you said (or what you didn’t say). Think about why you weren’t more assertive. Did you not know what to say? Was this the problem? Then, try thinking ahead about what to say if this happens again. Even better, write down what you will say. Did you feel nervous? Was this the problem? Then, you will need to learn ways to keep calm. Did you feel shy? If so, you will need to make efforts to overcome being shy. For example, learn to focus on other people. Don’t think about your feelings of shyness. Were you scared to speak up? Why were you scared? Sometimes, we feel scared to try something new. We always do the same thing. We do it even if it doesn’t make us happy. We imagine something bad will happen if we speak up. However, most of the time the bad things we imagine do not happen. Maybe, something good will happen if you speak up. Maybe, you will get what you want. Maybe, things will change for the better. 3. Know the difference between assertive, aggressive, and passive-aggressive Before we can be assertive, we need to learn what it is. We also need to learn what it is not. Assertive people speak clearly. They respect how other people feel. They also respect how they feel. They respect their own feelings. They are always calm when they speak. Aggressive people speak too strongly. They think their ideas are the only good ones. They think how they feel is the most important. They do not respect other people’s feelings. They may look angry when they talk. Passive-aggressive people do not speak up for themselves. They smile and say “yes” to things they don’t want to do. Later, they become angry. You may ask a passive-aggressive person to do a job they don’t want to do. Then, watch out! They might complain or say bad things about you after taking the job. They might even try to do a bad job, because they are so angry at you. Usually, people don’t enjoy working or being in relationships with aggressive or passive-aggressive people. We want to enjoy good relationships with other people. That is why it is much better to try to be assertive. 4 . Learn ways to keep yourself calm If you want to be more assertive, you will need to learn how to keep yourself calm. Other people will not think you are assertive if you sound nervous or angry. Remember, sometimes, you may not be able to control your feelings. But, you don’t have to let your feelings control you. For example, someone may do something to make you angry. But, you don’t have to shout at them. You may feel nervous about speaking in front of a lot of people. But, do it anyway. Here are some ways to keep calm: Believe in yourself. If you believe that what you are saying is right, it will be easier to stay calm. If you feel you are doing the right thing, it will be easier not to feel nervous. Take deep breaths. If you feel yourself getting nervous or angry, breathe deeply through your nose and out of your mouth. Remember that people usually can’t see how you feel. Maybe, you feel your heart is beating fast. Maybe, you feel your knees are shaking. Maybe, you feel your hands are sweating. However, other people may not be able to see these things. If you try to stay calm, nobody will see that you are nervous. 5. Plan and practice Something else that will help you keep calm is to plan. Plan what you want to say. Think about what kinds of questions people may ask you. Plan how you can answer these questions. Write down what you want to say. Make sure you are clearly telling others what you want to say. Make sure other people can easily understand your message. Most of all, make sure that your words are kind. Make sure your words respect other people’s feelings. Now that you know what you are going to say, you need to practice. Practice saying the words. It is best to practice in front of a mirror. When you practice, watch your face. Do you look angry or nervous? Do you look scared? Try to look calm. Does your voice sound soft or weak? Make sure your voice is calm, but strong. If you plan and practice something a lot, you will feel more confident. You will have a better chance of being successful. Practice speaking up for yourself in the mirror. Then, you will have a better chance of being assertive in real life. 6. Use assertive body language The words you say are important. But, body language is important, too. Body language means how you stand and move your body and face. Body language gives people a message. Some body language is aggressive. Some body language is passive. However, we want to use assertive body language. Aggressive body language makes other people feel angry or scared. People with aggressive body language do not smile. They may stand too close to another person. They may look directly at the other person with angry eyes. Their voice may be too loud. They may cross their arms in front of themselves. And, they make fists. When people use passive body language, others are less likely to listen to what they have to say. People with passive body language may look at the floor. They don’t make eye contact. They don’t stand or sit up straight. They may speak too quietly. Assertive people stand or sit up straight. They look relaxed. They smile. They make eye contact. Their voice is clear and strong. They don’t speak too quickly. They don’t speak too loudly or too quietly. Other people want to listen when assertive people speak. 7. Use “I” instead of “you” When aggressive people speak up for themselves, they may use strong words. They use sentences that start with “you always” or “you never.” For example, they may say, “You always ask me to do extra work on the weekend. You never respect my free time.” Using sentences that start with “you always” or “you never” can make the other person feel angry or scared. When passive people try to speak up for themselves, they use weak words. They use sentences that start with “Maybe, I’m wrong, but. . .” For example, “Maybe, I’m wrong, but it seems I get a lot of extra work to do on the weekends.” Passive people try to make their words soft. This is because they don’t want to make anyone feel angry or sad. However, by doing this, passive people are telling others that their message is not so important. So, other people may not listen carefully to what they have to say. Assertive people use sentences that begin with “I think” or “I feel.” For example, “I think getting extra work to do on the weekend is bad for the company. I feel I can be a better worker if I have time to relax on the weekend.” Their words do not make others feel angry or sad. And, other people may listen carefully to what they have to say. 8. Start small When we want to make a change in our lives, it can be scary. It will be less scary if we try to make small changes first. Start small. Did a waiter or waitress give you the wrong food in a restaurant? Speak up and ask for the food you ordered. Is your family talking about what to do on the weekend? Speak up and say what YOU think would be fun to do. Did someone at school borrow your pen and forget to give it back? Speak up and ask for the pen back. Usually you will be successful if you try to be assertive in small ways. If you feel successful in small ways, you will feel confident. And then, you will feel more confident about being assertive in bigger ways. This is also good practice for when you have a problem to overcome. You may need to be assertive to manage something big. For example, asking your boss for more money is something big. Or, talking to your teacher if they give you the wrong score on a test. However, if you have practice with being assertive in small ways, taking care of bigger problems won’t be so scary. be Assertive 9. Be ready to say “no” You make plans with a friend to play tennis on a Saturday afternoon. However, your sister calls you. She asks you to watch her children, because she wants to go shopping. You don’t want to make your sister angry or sad. So, you tell your friend you cannot play. You look after your sister’s children all afternoon. But, you feel very angry about it. You really wanted to play tennis. In this case, be assertive from the beginning. Tell your sister, “No, I can’t watch your children. I have plans to play tennis.” You can enjoy your life more if you learn how to say “no.” You can have less stress. You can do the things you want to do. And, if you say “no” in a nice way, people won’t be angry with you. They won’t feel sad. How can you tell someone “no” without people getting angry at you? How can you say “no” without people feeling sad? Here are some examples of ways you can tell someone “no”: • I’m sorry, but . . . • I’d love to, but. . . • That sounds really interesting, but. . . • I wish I could, but. . . You don’t need to tell a lie when you say “no.” Say what is true. Just, be assertive. Remember, your time is just as important as other people’s time. 10. Be ready for people to criticize the new assertive you A lot of good things will happen once you start being more assertive. Other people will respect you. People will listen to what you have to say. You will be happier. And, you will have less stress. Maybe, however, not everyone will be happy with the new you. If you have always been a passive person, some people may criticize you. They might not understand why you are saying “no” to them. They might not understand why you are speaking up for yourself. They might not like the changes you are making in your life. When people criticize you, listen to what they have to say. If the criticism is true, then think about it and learn from it. However, you may feel the criticism is wrong. If the criticism is not fair, you don’t have to worry about it. Hold your head up high, smile, and be happy. Some people may not like the new assertive you. They may like the ‘old you’ better. They may like the passive you better. But, did you like yourself? Especially at work or school, isn’t it better to have people respect you than to like you? Your true friends will like the new assertive you. Your true friends will listen to you. And, your true friends will be happy you are changing your life.

Introduction We need money to live. We need to pay for things each month. We need to pay for our house or apartment. We need to pay for utilities such as gas, electricity, and water. We need to pay for food. We need to pay for trains and buses. We may also pay for things when going out with our friends. Most people make a budget each month. Then, we know how much money we have. We know how much we need to pay for things. And, we know how much money we have left. We know how much we can spend on other things we want. Sometimes, however, we have to pay for something extra. We have to pay for something that is not in our budget. Maybe, it’s a friend’s birthday. We want to buy them something special. Or, maybe our washing machine stops working. We need to buy a new one. Maybe, we become sick. We have to pay to see a doctor. Sometimes, it can be difficult to pay for all the things we need every month. Maybe, we do not have much money. Maybe, our job does not pay well. Or, we have to pay a lot of money to study at school. Maybe, we just spend too much money. However, there are many ways we can use less money every month. There are many ways we can live more cheaply. This can leave us with more money for the things we want to do. Now, stop and think for a moment. Do you want to live more cheaply? Is it difficult for you to pay for everything you need each month? Do you want to find ways to spend less money? Let’s look at 10 ways to live more cheaply: Live Cheaply 1. Lower the cost of your utilities It is difficult to lower the cost of where we live. We may have to pay rent. Or, we may have to pay the bank for our home loan. But, we can lower the cost of our utilities. Utilities are things such as electricity, gas, and water. We need these things every day. But, do we need to use so much of them? Using less electricity, gas, and water can help us to live more cheaply. To use less water, fill a small bowl with water to wash your dishes. Take shorter showers - even a few minutes shorter each day will use much less water. If you take a bath, keep the water. Use it for the washing machine. Or, use it for the garden. To save money on electricity, turn off machines that you’re not using. Turn off lights when you leave a room. Heaters and air conditioners use a lot of electricity. So, change the temperature. Turn heaters down. Turn air conditioners up. If you are cold, wear more clothes. If you are hot, open a window. To save gas, lower the temperature when taking a shower or bath. When you are cooking, make a lot of food at once. This uses less gas than cooking each day. The cost of utilities can soon add up. Lowering your use of utilities can help you live more cheaply. Live Cheaply 2. Lower your smartphone costs We love our smartphones. It is difficult to think about not having a smartphone. These days we use them for many things. We use them to check the time of trains. We use them to look for information. We use them to send messages to friends and family. We watch videos on them. We listen to music on them. They are very useful. But, we often pay much more than we need to for them. We often pay this money to big companies. And, we can pay for smartphone services we do not need. When shopping for a smartphone, go to different companies. There are many smaller companies that can be cheaper. They have different data plans. Ask which plan is best for you. Compare prices. Think about how you can use your smartphone more cheaply. Do you make lots of calls? Do you listen to lots of music? Do you watch lots of videos? Do you spend lots of time online on your phone? Or, do you use your phone mostly for sending text messages? Find the cheapest plan for how you use your phone. Also, these days, there are many applications that give you free phone calls. We do not need to pay to call somebody. And, in public places, there is often free WiFi. So, use it rather than using up your own data! Live Cheaply 3. Lower your food costs Another way to live cheaply is to lower your costs when shopping for food. This does not mean you will be hungry. But, if you think about how you shop, you can save a lot of money. Many supermarkets have cheap days for shopping. Learn when your local supermarket lowers its prices. Do your shopping then. Do not go shopping every day. If you plan well, you can save money. Buy more expensive items such as meat and fish when the prices are cheaper. Or, eat less meat and fish. Look at where everything is in the supermarket. Everyday items, such as milk, vegetables, and meat are easy to see. They are around the edge of the supermarket. In the middle is junk food and processed food. Do not go into the middle of the supermarket. Live Cheaply The food in the middle is often more expensive. It is also not very healthy. Other ways to live cheaply are to take a drink from home when you go out. Make your own lunch to take to work or school. Do you have a small place to grow vegetables? Vegetables can be easy and cheap to grow. Also, shop for food online. Often, you can buy food in large quantities. This makes it cheaper to buy. And, avoid shopping in convenience stores. They are more expensive than other food stores. 4. Learn new skills. At home, sometimes things break. They need repairing. Also, some things may need regular maintenance. How often do you pay someone to do a job for you? You may pay someone to change your oil in your car. You may pay someone to paint the house. You may pay someone to do your garden. You may pay someone to repair a door or window. We often call someone with the right skill to come and do these small jobs for us. But, we can learn how to repair things ourselves. We can learn how to maintain things so that they work well. Some big jobs may still need a skilled person. But, we can learn to do the smaller jobs ourselves. It is not difficult to paint the house. Do simple car or bicycle maintenance yourself. If something breaks, try to repair it. Don’t just buy a new one. Look online for how to do simple repairs. Or, find a book in the library. You can save a lot of money by doing these jobs yourself. In modern life, many people buy things. When something breaks, they quickly throw it away. They buy a new one. To live cheaply, don’t do this. Think about repairing it yourself. You can save money. And, you also learn new skills. Live Cheaply 5. Sell your car Having your own car is great. You can go where we want. You can go when you want. But, how often do you use your car for a fun day trip? Most of us use our car for getting to and from work or school. We use our car to go to the supermarket. So, ask yourself, “Do you really need your car?” Cars are expensive in many ways. Gas is expensive. You also need insurance. You need to pay for maintenance costs. You need to pay for other costs, too. Sometimes, you need to pay to park your car near your house. It all starts to add up. So, write down how much you spend on your car every year. Compare it with how much money the bus or train will cost you. It will probably be much cheaper to take the bus or train. Is your work or school near your house? Can you go there by bicycle? Bicycles cost nothing to use. Using a bicycle can save you a lot of money. It is good for your health. And, it is better for the environment. Also, if you want to go on a long trip, you can always rent a car. Renting a car for a few days is cheaper than having your own car. Live Cheaply 6. Buy high-quality clothes These days, we buy a lot of clothes. We wash and change our clothes more often than before. Clothes are usually made very cheaply. They are made in other countries where costs are low. So, they are not expensive to buy. But, cheap clothes cannot be used for a long time. After a short time, they do not look good. Because of this, people throw them away. To live cheaply, spend more money on your clothes. This might sound like a strange way to save money. But, spending more money on quality clothes will save you money over time. Cheap shoes do not last for a long time. They soon break. They soon get holes in them. They also often do not fit you well and can hurt your feet. Buy high-quality shoes. Maintain then. Keep them clean. And, you will be able to wear them for many years. They will look good for a long time too. Buy high-quality coats and jackets. Spend more money on a few high-quality items. Take care of the items you buy. Maintain them. Keep them clean. Put them away when you come home. You will be able to wear them for many years. You will always look smart and feel good. And, you won’t need to keep buying new clothes. Live Cheaply 7. Collect points Collecting points is a good way to save money. Do you use credit cards? Do you have point cards for lots of different stores? Most stores and credit card companies give you points for using them. Sometimes, it feels like a lot of trouble to carry so many cards. But, they can save you money over time. Look at which credit cards offer you the most points for your shopping. Read the information carefully. Use the credit card that gives you the most points. Buy everything with that credit card. Collect lots of points. But, remember to keep enough money to pay your credit card company each month. It will cost you a lot of money if you don’t. When you have collected lots of points think about how you can use them. Use the points in a way that saves you the most money. With store point cards, you may not get many points every time you shop. But, these points do add up quickly. You can soon find you have collected many points. So, try to shop in the same stores each time and collect the points. Even supermarkets have point cards. You can use these points to buy food. Of course, it is nice to buy something special for yourself. But, use points to buy the things you really need. Then, you can live more cheaply. Live Cheaply 8. Have fun cheaply It is fun to get together with family and friends. It is fun to go to restaurants. It is fun to go to the movies. We all want to have fun with our friends or family. But, eating in restaurants can be expensive. So, look for special restaurant offers and discount tickets. For example, sometimes, you can eat as much food as you want cheaply. Sometimes, you can get a free dish or drink on a special day. Or, sometimes, you can get a discount if you download the restaurant application to your smartphone. Also, remember that drinks in restaurants are always expensive. Just drink water. It’s usually free. Going to the movies can cost a lot of money. Most movie theaters have a cheap day each week. Find out which day is the cheapest day to go. Avoid buying popcorn and large drinks at the movie theater. If you want a snack, take a cheap one with you - You may have to hide it in your bag!

Health problems can cost you money from visits to the doctor and for medicine. You may also lose money taking time off work. Health problems can quickly become a problem for your budget. Of course, we cannot avoid all health problems. Some people have health problems even though they live a healthy lifestyle. But there are ways you can try to stay as healthy as possible. Eating well is a good first step. Eat healthy food. Avoid eating too much junk food or processed food. Try to exercise often. Go for a walk when you can.

INTRODUCTION We Americans devour eagerly any piece of writing that purports to tellus the secret of success in life; yet how often we are disappointed tofind nothing but commonplace statements, or receipts that we know byheart but never follow. Most of the life stories of our famous andsuccessful men fail to inspire because they lack the human elementthat makes the record real and brings the story within our grasp.While we are searching far and near for some Aladdin's Lamp to givecoveted fortune, there is ready at our hand if we will only reach outand take it, like the charm in Milton's _Comus_, "Unknown, and like esteemed, and the dull swain Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon;" the interesting, human, and vividly told story of one of the wisestand most useful lives in our own history, and perhaps in any history.In Franklin's _Autobiography_ is offered not so much a ready-madeformula for success, as the companionship of a real flesh and bloodman of extraordinary mind and quality, whose daily walk andconversation will help us to meet our own difficulties, much as doesthe example of a wise and strong friend. While we are fascinated bythe story, we absorb the human experience through which a strong andhelpful character is building. The thing that makes Franklin's _Autobiography_ different from everyother life story of a great and successful man is just this humanaspect of the account. Franklin told the story of his life, as hehimself says, for the benefit of his posterity. He wanted to help themby the relation of his own rise from obscurity and poverty to eminenceand wealth. He is not unmindful of the importance of his publicservices and their recognition, yet his accounts of these achievementsare given only as a part of the story, and the vanity displayed isincidental and in keeping with the honesty of the recital. There isnothing of the impossible in the method and practice of Franklin as hesets them forth. The youth who reads the fascinating story isastonished to find that Franklin in his early years struggled with thesame everyday passions and difficulties that he himself experiences,and he loses the sense of discouragement that comes from arealization of his own shortcomings and inability to attain. There are other reasons why the _Autobiography_ should be an intimatefriend of American young people. Here they may establish a closerelationship with one of the foremost Americans as well as one of thewisest men of his age. The life of Benjamin Franklin is of importance to every Americanprimarily because of the part he played in securing the independenceof the United States and in establishing it as a nation. Franklinshares with Washington the honors of the Revolution, and of the eventsleading to the birth of the new nation. While Washington was theanimating spirit of the struggle in the colonies, Franklin was itsablest champion abroad. To Franklin's cogent reasoning and keensatire, we owe the clear and forcible presentation of the Americancase in England and France; while to his personality and diplomacy aswell as to his facile pen, we are indebted for the foreign allianceand the funds without which Washington's work must have failed. Hispatience, fortitude, and practical wisdom, coupled withself-sacrificing devotion to the cause of his country, are hardly lessnoticeable than similar qualities displayed by Washington. In fact,Franklin as a public man was much like Washington, especially in theentire disinterestedness of his public service. Franklin is also interesting to us because by his life and teachingshe has done more than any other American to advance the materialprosperity of his countrymen. It is said that his widely andfaithfully read maxims made Philadelphia and Pennsylvania wealthy,while Poor Richard's pithy sayings, translated into many languages,have had a world-wide influence. Franklin is a good type of our American manhood. Although not thewealthiest or the most powerful, he is undoubtedly, in the versatilityof his genius and achievements, the greatest of our self-made men. Thesimple yet graphic story in the _Autobiography_ of his steady risefrom humble boyhood in a tallow-chandler shop, by industry, economy,and perseverance in self-improvement, to eminence, is the mostremarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men. It isin itself a wonderful illustration of the results possible to beattained in a land of unequaled opportunity by following Franklin'smaxims. Franklin's fame, however, was not confined to his own country.Although he lived in a century notable for the rapid evolution ofscientific and political thought and activity, yet no less a keenjudge and critic than Lord Jeffrey, the famous editor of the_Edinburgh Review_, a century ago said that "in one point of viewthe name of Franklin must be considered as standing higher than any ofthe others which illustrated the eighteenth century. Distinguished asa statesman, he was equally great as a philosopher, thus uniting inhimself a rare degree of excellence in both these pursuits, to excelin either of which is deemed the highest praise." Franklin has indeed been aptly called "many-sided." He was eminent inscience and public service, in diplomacy and in literature. He was theEdison of his day, turning his scientific discoveries to the benefitof his fellow-men. He perceived the identity of lightning andelectricity and set up the lightning rod. He invented the Franklinstove, still widely used, and refused to patent it. He possessed amasterly shrewdness in business and practical affairs. Carlyle calledhim the father of all the Yankees. He founded a fire company, assistedin founding a hospital, and improved the cleaning and lighting ofstreets. He developed journalism, established the AmericanPhilosophical Society, the public library in Philadelphia, and theUniversity of Pennsylvania. He organized a postal system for thecolonies, which was the basis of the present United States PostOffice. Bancroft, the eminent historian, called him "the greatestdiplomatist of his century." He perfected the Albany Plan of Union forthe colonies. He is the only statesman who signed the Declaration ofIndependence, the Treaty of Alliance with France, the Treaty of Peacewith England, and the Constitution. As a writer, he has produced, inhis _Autobiography_ and in _Poor Richard's Almanac_, two works thatare not surpassed by similar writing. He received honorary degreesfrom Harvard and Yale, from Oxford and St. Andrews, and was made afellow of the Royal Society, which awarded him the Copley gold medalfor improving natural knowledge. He was one of the eight foreignassociates of the French Academy of Science. The careful study of the _Autobiography_ is also valuable because ofthe style in which it is written. If Robert Louis Stevenson is rightin believing that his remarkable style was acquired by imitation thenthe youth who would gain the power to express his ideas clearly,forcibly, and interestingly cannot do better than to study Franklin'smethod. Franklin's fame in the scientific world was due almost as muchto his modest, simple, and sincere manner of presenting hisdiscoveries and to the precision and clearness of the style in whichhe described his experiments, as to the results he was able toannounce. Sir Humphry Davy, the celebrated English chemist, himself anexcellent literary critic as well as a great scientist, said: "Asingular felicity guided all Franklin's researches, and by very smallmeans he established very grand truths. The style and manner of hispublication on electricity are almost as worthy of admiration as thedoctrine it contains." Franklin's place in literature is hard to determine because he was notprimarily a literary man. His aim in his writings as in his life workwas to be helpful to his fellow-men. For him writing was never an endin itself, but always a means to an end. Yet his success as ascientist, a statesman, and a diplomat, as well as socially, was in nolittle part due to his ability as a writer. "His letters charmed all,and made his correspondence eagerly sought. His political argumentswere the joy of his party and the dread of his opponents. Hisscientific discoveries were explained in language at once so simpleand so clear that plow-boy and exquisite could follow his thought orhis experiment to its conclusion." _The Many-Sided Franklin._ Paul L. Ford. As far as American literature is concerned, Franklin has nocontemporaries. Before the _Autobiography_ only one literary work ofimportance had been produced in this country--Cotton Mather's_Magnalia_, a church history of New England in a ponderous, stiffstyle. Franklin was the first American author to gain a wide andpermanent reputation in Europe. The _Autobiography_, _Poor Richard_,_Father Abraham's Speech_ or _The Way to Wealth_, as well as some ofthe _Bagatelles_, are as widely known abroad as any American writings.Franklin must also be classed as the first American humorist. English literature of the eighteenth century was characterized by thedevelopment of prose. Periodical literature reached its perfectionearly in the century in _The Tatler_ and _The Spectator_ of Addisonand Steele. Pamphleteers flourished throughout the period. Thehomelier prose of Bunyan and Defoe gradually gave place to the moreelegant and artificial language of Samuel Johnson, who set thestandard for prose writing from 1745 onward. This century saw thebeginnings of the modern novel, in Fielding's _Tom Jones_,Richardson's _Clarissa Harlowe_, Sterne's _Tristram Shandy_, andGoldsmith's _Vicar of Wakefield_. Gibbon wrote _The Decline and Fallof the Roman Empire_, Hume his _History of England_, and Adam Smiththe _Wealth of Nations_. In the simplicity and vigor of his style Franklin more nearlyresembles the earlier group of writers. In his first essays he was notan inferior imitator of Addison. In his numerous parables, moralallegories, and apologues he showed Bunyan's influence. But Franklinwas essentially a journalist. In his swift, terse style, he is mostlike Defoe, who was the first great English journalist and master ofthe newspaper narrative. The style of both writers is marked byhomely, vigorous expression, satire, burlesque, repartee. Here thecomparison must end. Defoe and his contemporaries were authors. Theirvocation was writing and their success rests on the imaginative orcreative power they displayed. To authorship Franklin laid no claim.He wrote no work of the imagination. He developed only incidentally astyle in many respects as remarkable as that of his Englishcontemporaries. He wrote the best autobiography in existence, one ofthe most widely known collections of maxims, and an unsurpassed seriesof political and social satires, because he was a man of unusual scopeof power and usefulness, who knew how to tell his fellow-men thesecrets of that power and that usefulness. The Story of the Autobiography The account of how Franklin's _Autobiography_ came to be written andof the adventures of the original manuscript forms in itself aninteresting story. The _Autobiography_ is Franklin's longest work,and yet it is only a fragment. The first part, written as a letter tohis son, William Franklin, was not intended for publication; and thecomposition is more informal and the narrative more personal than inthe second part, from 1730 on, which was written with a view topublication. The entire manuscript shows little evidence of revision.In fact, the expression is so homely and natural that his grandson,William Temple Franklin, in editing the work changed some of thephrases because he thought them inelegant and vulgar. Franklin began the story of his life while on a visit to his friend,Bishop Shipley, at Twyford, in Hampshire, southern England, in 1771.He took the manuscript, completed to 1731, with him when he returnedto Philadelphia in 1775. It was left there with his other papers whenhe went to France in the following year, and disappeared during theconfusion incident to the Revolution. Twenty-three pages of closelywritten manuscript fell into the hands of Abel James, an old friend,who sent a copy to Franklin at Passy, near Paris, urging him tocomplete the story. Franklin took up the work at Passy in 1784 andcarried the narrative forward a few months. He changed the plan tomeet his new purpose of writing to benefit the young reader. His workwas soon interrupted and was not resumed until 1788, when he was athome in Philadelphia. He was now old, infirm, and suffering, and wasstill engaged in public service. Under these discouraging conditionsthe work progressed slowly. It finally stopped when the narrativereached the year 1757. Copies of the manuscript were sent to friendsof Franklin in England and France, among others to Monsieur LeVeillard at Paris. The first edition of the _Autobiography_ was published in French atParis in 1791. It was clumsily and carelessly translated, and wasimperfect and unfinished. Where the translator got the manuscript isnot known. Le Veillard disclaimed any knowledge of the publication.From this faulty French edition many others were printed, some inGermany, two in England, and another in France, so great was thedemand for the work. In the meantime the original manuscript of the _Autobiography_ hadstarted on a varied and adventurous career. It was left by Franklinwith his other works to his grandson, William Temple Franklin, whomFranklin designated as his literary executor. When Temple Franklincame to publish his grandfather's works in 1817, he sent the originalmanuscript of the _Autobiography_ to the daughter of Le Veillard inexchange for her father's copy, probably thinking the clearertranscript would make better printer's copy. The original manuscriptthus found its way to the Le Veillard family and connections, where itremained until sold in 1867 to Mr. John Bigelow, United StatesMinister to France. By him it was later sold to Mr. E. Dwight Churchof New York, and passed with the rest of Mr. Church's library into thepossession of Mr. Henry E. Huntington. The original manuscript ofFranklin's _Autobiography_ now rests in the vault in Mr. Huntington'sresidence at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-seventh Street, New York City. When Mr. Bigelow came to examine his purchase, he was astonished tofind that what people had been reading for years as the authentic_Life of Benjamin Franklin by Himself_, was only a garbled andincomplete version of the real _Autobiography_. Temple Franklin hadtaken unwarranted liberties with the original. Mr. Bigelow says hefound more than twelve hundred changes in the text. In 1868,therefore, Mr. Bigelow published the standard edition of Franklin's_Autobiography_. It corrected errors in the previous editions and wasthe first English edition to contain the short fourth part,comprising the last few pages of the manuscript, written during thelast year of Franklin's life. Mr. Bigelow republished the_Autobiography_, with additional interesting matter, in three volumesin 1875, in 1905, and in 1910. The text in this volume is that of Mr.Bigelow's editions. For the division into chapters and the however, the present editor is responsible. The _Autobiography_ has been reprinted in the United States manyscores of times and translated into all the languages of Europe. Ithas never lost its popularity and is still in constant demand atcirculating libraries. The reason for this popularity is not far toseek. For in this work Franklin told in a remarkable manner the storyof a remarkable life. He displayed hard common sense and a practicalknowledge of the art of living. He selected and arranged his material,perhaps unconsciously, with the unerring instinct of the journalistfor the best effects. His success is not a little due to his plain,clear, vigorous English. He used short sentences and words, homelyexpressions, apt illustrations, and pointed allusions. Franklin had amost interesting, varied, and unusual life. He was one of the greatestconversationalists of his time. His book is the record of that unusual life told in Franklin's ownunexcelled conversational style. It is said that the best parts ofBoswell's famous biography of Samuel Johnson are those parts whereBoswell permits Johnson to tell his own story. In the _Autobiography_a no less remarkable man and talker than Samuel Johnson is telling hisown story throughout. F. W. P. The Gilman Country School,Baltimore, September, 1916. AUTOBIOGRAPHYOFBENJAMIN FRANKLIN I ANCESTRY AND EARLY YOUTH INBOSTON Twyford, _at the Bishop of St. Asaph's_, 1771. Dear son: I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotesof my ancestors. You may remember the inquiries I made among theremains of my relations when you were with me in England, and thejourney I undertook for that purpose. Imagining it may be equallyagreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life, many of whichyou are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week'suninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down towrite them for you. To which I have besides some other inducements.Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born andbred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in theworld, and having gone so far through life with a considerable shareof felicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with theblessing of God so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, asthey may find some of them suitable to their own situations, andtherefore fit to be imitated. A small village not far from Winchester in Hampshire, southern England. Here was the country seat of the Bishop of St. Asaph, Dr. Jonathan Shipley, the "good Bishop," as Dr. Franklin used to style him. Their relations were intimate and confidential. In his pulpit, and in the House of Lords, as well as in society, the bishop always opposed the harsh measures of the Crown toward the Colonies.--Bigelow. That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes tosay, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection toa repetition of the same life from its beginning, only asking theadvantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults ofthe first. So I might, besides correcting the faults, change somesinister accidents and events of it for others more favourable. Butthough this were denied, I should still accept the offer. Since such arepetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like livingone's life over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and tomake that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down inwriting. Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, tobe talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shallindulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect toage, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, sincethis may be read or not as anyone pleases. And, lastly (I may as wellconfess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhapsI shall a good deal gratify my own _vanity_. Indeed, I scarce everheard or saw the introductory words, "_Without vanity I may say_,"etc., but some vain thing immediately followed. Most people dislikevanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves; but Igive it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that itis often productive of good to the possessor, and to others that arewithin his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it wouldnot be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanityamong the other comforts of life. In this connection Woodrow Wilson says, "And yet the surprising and delightful thing about this book (the _Autobiography_) is that, take it all in all, it has not the low tone of conceit, but is a staunch man's sober and unaffected assessment of himself and the circumstances of his career." Gibbon and Hume, the great British historians, who were contemporaries of Franklin, express in their autobiographies the same feeling about the propriety of just self-praise. And now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility toacknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to Hiskind providence, which lead me to the means I used and gave themsuccess. My belief of this induces me to _hope_, though I must not_presume_, that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me,in continuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse,which I may experience as others have done; the complexion of myfuture fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to blessto us even our afflictions. The notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity incollecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands, furnished me withseveral particulars relating to our ancestors. From these notes Ilearned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, inNorthamptonshire, for three hundred years, and how much longer heknew not (perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin, that beforewas the name of an order of people, was assumed by them as asurname when others took surnames all over the kingdom), on a freeholdof about thirty acres, aided by the smith's business, which hadcontinued in the family till his time, the eldest son being alwaysbred to that business; a custom which he and my father followed as totheir eldest sons. When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found anaccount of their births, marriages and burials from the year 1555only, there being no registers kept in that parish at any timepreceding. By that register I perceived that I was the youngest son ofthe youngest son for five generations back. My grandfather Thomas, whowas born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to followbusiness longer, when he went to live with his son John, a dyer atBanbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship.There my grandfather died and lies buried. We saw his gravestone in1758. His eldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton, and left itwith the land to his only child, a daughter, who, with her husband,one Fisher, of Wellingborough, sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of themanor there. My grandfather had four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas,John, Benjamin and Josiah. I will give you what account I can of themat this distance from my papers, and if these are not lost in myabsence, you will among them find many more particulars. See _Introduction_. A small landowner. Thomas was bred a smith under his father; but, being ingenious, andencouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an Esquire Palmer,then the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualified himself forthe business of scrivener; became a considerable man in the county;was a chief mover of all public-spirited undertakings for the countyor town of Northampton, and his own village, of which many instanceswere related of him; and much taken notice of and patronized by thethen Lord Halifax. He died in 1702, January 6, old style, just fouryears to a day before I was born. The account we received of his lifeand character from some old people at Ecton, I remember, struck you assomething extraordinary, from its similarity to what you knew of mine."Had he died on the same day," you said, "one might have supposed atransmigration." January 17, new style. This change in the calendar was made in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, and adopted in England in 1752. Every year whose number in the common reckoning since Christ is not divisible by 4, as well as every year whose number is divisible by 100 but not by 400, shall have 365 days, and all other years shall have 366 days. In the eighteenth century there was a difference of eleven days between the old and the new style of reckoning, which the English Parliament canceled by making the 3rd of September, 1752, the 14th. The Julian calendar, or "old style," is still retained in Russia and Greece, whose dates consequently are now 13 days behind those of other Christian countries. John was bred a dyer, I believe of woollens, Benjamin was bred a silkdyer, serving an apprenticeship at London. He was an ingenious man. Iremember him well, for when I was a boy he came over to my father inBoston, and lived in the house with us some years. He lived to agreat age. His grandson, Samuel Franklin, now lives in Boston. He leftbehind him two quarto volumes, MS., of his own poetry, consisting oflittle occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations, ofwhich the following, sent to me, is a specimen. He had formed ashort-hand of his own, which he taught me, but, never practising it, Ihave now forgot it. I was named after this uncle, there being aparticular affection between him and my father. He was very pious, agreat attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he took down inhis short-hand, and had with him many volumes of them. He was alsomuch of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station. There felllately into my hands, in London, a collection he had made of all theprincipal pamphlets relating to public affairs, from 1641 to 1717;many of the volumes are wanting as appears by the numbering, butthere still remain eight volumes in folio, and twenty-four in quartoand in octavo. A dealer in old books met with them, and knowing me bymy sometimes buying of him, he brought them to me. It seems my unclemust have left them here when he went to America, which was aboutfifty years since. There are many of his notes in the margins. The specimen is not in the manuscript of the _Autobiography_. This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, andcontinued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary, when they weresometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal againstpopery. They had got an English Bible, and to conceal and secure it,it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of ajoint-stool. When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, heturned up the joint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves thenunder the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give noticeif he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritualcourt. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet,when the Bible remained concealed under it as before. This anecdote Ihad from my uncle Benjamin. The family continued all of the Church ofEngland till about the end of Charles the Second's reign, when some ofthe ministers that had been outed for non-conformity, holdingconventicles in Northamptonshire, Benjamin and Josiah adhered tothem, and so continued all their lives: the rest of the familyremained with the Episcopal Church. Secret gatherings of dissenters from the established Church. Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with threechildren into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having beenforbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerablemen of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he wasprevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoytheir mode of religion with freedom. By the same wife he had fourchildren more born there, and by a second wife ten more, in allseventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one time at histable, who all grew up to be men and women, and married; I was theyoungest son, and the youngest child but two, and was born in Boston,New England. My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger,daughter of Peter Folger, one of the first settlers of New England, ofwhom honorable mention is made by Cotton Mather, in his churchhistory of that country, entitled _Magnalia Christi Americana_, as "_agodly, learned Englishman_," if I remember the words rightly. I haveheard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces, but only one ofthem was printed, which I saw now many years since. It was written in1675, in the home-spun verse of that time and people, and addressed tothose then concerned in the government there. It was in favour ofliberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists, Quakers, andother sectaries that had been under persecution, ascribing the Indianwars, and other distresses that had befallen the country, to thatpersecution, as so many judgments of God to punish so heinous anoffense, and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws. The wholeappeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness andmanly freedom. The six concluding lines I remember, though I haveforgotten the two first of the stanza; but the purport of them was,that his censures proceeded from good-will, and, therefore, he wouldbe known to be the author. "Because to be a libeller (says he) I hate it with my heart; From Sherburne town, where now I dwell My name I do put here; Without offense your real friend, It is Peter Folgier." Franklin was born on Sunday, January 6, old style, 1706, in a house on Milk Street, opposite the Old South Meeting House, where he was baptized on the day of his birth, during a snowstorm. The house where he was born was burned in 1810.--Griffin. Cotton Mather (1663-1728), clergyman, author, and scholar. Pastor of the North Church, Boston. He took an active part in the persecution of witchcraft. Nantucket. My elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades. I wasput to the grammar-school at eight years of age, my father intendingto devote me, as the tithe of his sons, to the service of theChurch. My early readiness in learning to read (which must have beenvery early, as I do not remember when I could not read), and theopinion of all his friends, that I should certainly make a goodscholar, encouraged him in this purpose of his. My uncle Benjamin,too, approved of it, and proposed to give me all his short-handvolumes of sermons, I suppose as a stock to set up with, if I wouldlearn his character. I continued, however, at the grammar-schoolnot quite one year, though in that time I had risen gradually from themiddle of the class of that year to be the head of it, and farther wasremoved into the next class above it, in order to go with that intothe third at the end of the year. But my father, in the meantime, froma view of the expense of a college education, which having so large afamily he could not well afford, and the mean living many so educatedwere afterwards able to obtain--reasons that he gave to his friends inmy hearing--altered his first intention, took me from thegrammar-school, and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic,kept by a then famous man, Mr. George Brownell, very successful inhis profession generally, and that by mild, encouraging methods. Underhim I acquired fair writing pretty soon, but I failed in thearithmetic, and made no progress in it. At ten years old I was takenhome to assist my father in his business, which was that of atallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business he was not bred to, buthad assumed on his arrival in New England, and on finding his dyeingtrade would not maintain his family, being in little request.Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wick for the candles, fillingthe dipping mould and the moulds for cast candles, attending the shop,going of errands, etc. Tenth. System of short-hand. I disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea, but myfather declared against it; however, living near the water, I was muchin and about it, learnt early to swim well, and to manage boats; andwhen in a boat or canoe with other boys, I was commonly allowed togovern, especially in any case of difficulty; and upon other occasionsI was generally a leader among the boys, and sometimes led them intoscrapes, of which I will mention one instance, as it shows an earlyprojecting public spirit, tho' not then justly conducted. There was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond, on the edgeof which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows. By muchtrampling, we had made it a mere quagmire. My proposal was to build awharf there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a largeheap of stones, which were intended for a new house near the marsh,and which would very well suit our purpose. Accordingly, in theevening, when the workmen were gone, I assembled a number of myplayfellows, and working with them diligently like so many emmets,sometimes two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and builtour little wharf. The next morning the workmen were surprised atmissing the stones, which were found in our wharf. Inquiry was madeafter the removers; we were discovered and complained of; several ofus were corrected by our fathers; and, though I pleaded the usefulnessof the work, mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was nothonest. I think you may like to know something of his person and character. Hehad an excellent constitution of body, was of middle stature, but wellset, and very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily, wasskilled a little in music, and had a clear, pleasing voice, so thatwhen he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal, as hesometimes did in an evening after the business of the day was over, itwas extremely agreeable to hear. He had a mechanical genius too, and,on occasion, was very handy in the use of other tradesmen's tools; buthis great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgmentin prudential matters, both in private and publick affairs. In thelatter, indeed, he was never employed, the numerous family he had toeducate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close tohis trade; but I remember well his being frequently visited by leadingpeople, who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or ofthe church he belonged to, and showed a good deal of respect for hisjudgment and advice: he was also much consulted by private personsabout their affairs when any difficulty occurred, and frequentlychosen an arbitrator between contending parties. At his table he likedto have, as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor toconverse with, and always took care to start some ingenious or usefultopic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of hischildren. By this means he turned our attention to what was good,just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice wasever taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether itwas well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor,preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind, sothat I was bro't up in such a perfect inattention to those matters asto be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and sounobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell afew hours after dinner what I dined upon. This has been a convenienceto me in traveling, where my companions have been sometimes veryunhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate,because better instructed, tastes and appetites. My mother had likewise an excellent constitution: she suckled all herten children. I never knew either my father or mother to have anysickness but that of which they dy'd, he at 89, and she at 85 years ofage. They lie buried together at Boston, where I some years sinceplaced a marble over their grave, with this inscription: Josiah Franklin, and Abiah his wife, lie here interred. They lived lovingly together in wedlock fifty-five years. Without an estate, or any gainful employment, By constant labor and industry, with God's blessing, They maintained a large family comfortably, and brought up thirteen children and seven grandchildren reputably.

This marble having decayed, the citizens of Boston in 1827 erected in its place a granite obelisk, twenty-one feet high, bearing the original inscription quoted in the text and another explaining the erection of the monument. By my rambling digressions I perceive myself to be grown old. I us'dto write more methodically. But one does not dress for private companyas for a publick ball. 'Tis perhaps only negligence. To return: I continued thus employed in my father's business for twoyears, that is, till I was twelve years old; and my brother John, whowas bred to that business, having left my father, married, and set upfor himself at Rhode Island, there was all appearance that I wasdestined to supply his place, and become a tallow-chandler. But mydislike to the trade continuing, my father was under apprehensionsthat if he did not find one for me more agreeable, I should break awayand get to sea, as his son Josiah had done, to his great vexation. Hetherefore sometimes took me to walk with him, and see joiners,bricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work, that he mightobserve my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on some trade or otheron land. It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmenhandle their tools; and it has been useful to me, having learnt somuch by it as to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when aworkman could not readily be got, and to construct little machines formy experiments, while the intention of making the experiment was freshand warm in my mind. My father at last fixed upon the cutler's trade,and my uncle Benjamin's son Samuel, who was bred to that business inLondon, being about that time established in Boston, I was sent to bewith him some time on liking. But his expectations of a fee with medispleasing my father, I was taken home again. II BEGINNING LIFE AS A PRINTER From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that cameinto my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the _Pilgrim'sProgress_, my first collection was of John Bunyan's works in separatelittle volumes. I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton's_Historical Collections_; they were small chapmen's books, andcheap, 40 or 50 in all. My father's little library consisted chieflyof books in polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have sinceoften regretted that, at a time when I had such a thirst forknowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way, since it wasnow resolved I should not be a clergyman. Plutarch's _Lives_ there wasin which I read abundantly, and I still think that time spent to greatadvantage. There was also a book of DeFoe's, called an _Essay onProjects_, and another of Dr. Mather's, called _Essays to do Good_,which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence onsome of the principal future events of my life. Small books, sold by chapmen or peddlers. This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me aprinter, though he had already one son (James) of that profession. In1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and lettersto set up his business in Boston. I liked it much better than that ofmy father, but still had a hankering for the sea. To prevent theapprehended effect of such an inclination, my father was impatient tohave me bound to my brother. I stood out some time, but at last waspersuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve yearsold. I was to serve as an apprentice till I was twenty-one years ofage, only I was to be allowed journeyman's wages during the last year.In a little time I made great proficiency in the business, and becamea useful hand to my brother. I now had access to better books. Anacquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimesto borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon and clean.Often I sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night, whenthe book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in themorning, lest it should be missed or wanted. And after some time an ingenious tradesman, Mr. Matthew Adams, whohad a pretty collection of books, and who frequented ourprinting-house, took notice of me, invited me to his library, andvery kindly lent me such books as I chose to read. I now took a fancyto poetry, and made some little pieces; my brother, thinking it mightturn to account, encouraged me, and put me on composing occasionalballads. One was called _The Lighthouse Tragedy_, and contained anaccount of the drowning of Captain Worthilake, with his two daughters:the other was a sailor's song, on the taking of _Teach_ (orBlackbeard) the pirate. They were wretched stuff, in theGrub-street-ballad style; and when they were printed he sent meabout the town to sell them. The first sold wonderfully, the eventbeing recent, having made a great noise. This flattered my vanity; butmy father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances, and telling meverse-makers were generally beggars. So I escaped being a poet, mostprobably a very bad one; but as prose writing has been of great use tome in the course of my life, and was a principal means of myadvancement, I shall tell you how, in such a situation, I acquiredwhat little ability I have in that way. Grub-street: famous in English literature as the home of poor writers. There was another bookish lad in the town, John Collins by name, withwhom I was intimately acquainted. We sometimes disputed, and very fondwe were of argument, and very desirous of confuting one another,which disputatious turn, by the way, is apt to become a very badhabit, making people often extremely disagreeable in company by thecontradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice; and thence,besides souring and spoiling the conversation, is productive ofdisgusts and, perhaps enmities where you may have occasion forfriendship. I had caught it by reading my father's books of disputeabout religion. Persons of good sense, I have since observed, seldomfall into it, except lawyers, university men, and men of all sortsthat have been bred at Edinborough. A question was once, somehow or other, started between Collins and me,of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning, and theirabilities for study. He was of opinion that it was improper, and thatthey were naturally unequal to it. I took the contrary side, perhaps alittle for dispute's sake. He was naturally more eloquent, had a readyplenty of words, and sometimes, as I thought, bore me down more by hisfluency than by the strength of his reasons. As we parted withoutsettling the point, and were not to see one another again for sometime, I sat down to put my arguments in writing, which I copied fairand sent to him. He answered, and I replied. Three or four letters ofa side had passed, when my father happened to find my papers and readthem. Without entering into the discussion, he took occasion to talkto me about the manner of my writing; observed that, though I had theadvantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing (which Iow'd to the printing-house), I fell far short in elegance ofexpression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he convinced me byseveral instances. I saw the justice of his remarks, and thence grewmore attentive to the manner in writing, and determined to endeavor atimprovement. About this time I met with an odd volume of the _Spectator_. It wasthe third. I had never before seen any of them. I bought it, read itover and over, and was much delighted with it. I thought the writingexcellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it. With this view Itook some of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment ineach sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking atthe book, try'd to compleat the papers again, by expressing eachhinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressedbefore, in any suitable words that should come to hand. Then Icompared my _Spectator_ with the original, discovered some of myfaults, and corrected them. But I found I wanted a stock of words, ora readiness in recollecting and using them, which I thought I shouldhave acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses; sincethe continual occasion for words of the same import, but of differentlength, to suit the measure, or of different sound for the rhyme,would have laid me under a constant necessity of searching forvariety, and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind, and makeme master of it. Therefore I took some of the tales and turned theminto verse; and, after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten theprose, turned them back again. I also sometimes jumbled my collectionsof hints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reducethem into the best order, before I began to form the full sentencesand compleat the paper. This was to teach me method in the arrangementof thoughts. By comparing my work afterwards with the original, Idiscovered many faults and amended them; but I sometimes had thepleasure of fancying that, in certain particulars of small import, Ihad been lucky enough to improve the method of the language, and thisencouraged me to think I might possibly in time come to be a tolerableEnglish writer, of which I was extremely ambitious. My time for theseexercises and for reading was at night, after work or before it beganin the morning, or on Sundays, when I contrived to be in theprinting-house alone, evading as much as I could the common attendanceon public worship which my father used to exme when I was underhis care, and which indeed I still thought a duty, thought I couldnot, as it seemed to me, afford time to practise it. A daily London journal, comprising satirical essays on social subjects, published by Addison and Steele in 1711-1712. The _Spectator_ and its predecessor, the _Tatler_ (1709), marked the beginning of periodical literature. When about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book, written byone Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet. I determined to go into it.My brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boardedhimself and his apprentices in another family. My refusing to eatflesh occasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid for mysingularity. I made myself acquainted with Tryon's manner of preparingsome of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hastypudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if hewould give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I wouldboard myself. He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that Icould save half what he paid me. This was an additional fund forbuying books. But I had another advantage in it. My brother and therest going from the printing-house to their meals, I remained therealone, and, dispatching presently my light repast, which often was nomore than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins or a tartfrom the pastry-cook's, and a glass of water, had the rest of the timetill their return for study, in which I made the greater progress,from that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension whichusually attend temperance in eating and drinking. And now it was that, being on some occasion made asham'd of myignorance in figures, which I had twice failed in learning when atschool, I took Cocker's book of Arithmetick, and went through thewhole by myself with great ease. I also read Seller's and Shermy'sbooks of Navigation, and became acquainted with the little geometrythey contain; but never proceeded far in that science. And I readabout this time Locke _On Human Understanding_, and the _Art ofThinking_, by Messrs. du Port Royal. John Locke (1632-1704), a celebrated English philosopher, founder of the so-called "common-sense" school of philosophers. He drew up a constitution for the colonists of Carolina. A noted society of scholarly and devout men occupying the abbey of Port Royal near Paris, who published learned works, among them the one here referred to, better known as the _Port Royal Logic_. While I was intent on improving my language, I met with an Englishgrammar (I think it was Greenwood's), at the end of which there weretwo little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the latterfinishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic method; andsoon after I procur'd Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates, whereinthere are many instances of the same method. I was charm'd with it,adopted it, dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation,and put on the humble inquirer and doubter. And being then, fromreading Shaftesbury and Collins, become a real doubter in many pointsof our religious doctrine, I found this method safest for myself andvery embarrassing to those against whom I used it; therefore I took adelight in it, practis'd it continually, and grew very artful andexpert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge, intoconcessions, the consequences of which they did not foresee,entangling them in difficulties out of which they could not extricatethemselves, and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor mycause always deserved. I continu'd this method some few years, butgradually left it, retaining only the habit of expressing myself interms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced anything thatmay possibly be disputed, the words _certainly_, _undoubtedly_, or anyothers that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rathersay, I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears tome, or _I should think it so or so_, for such and such reasons; or _Iimagine it to be so_; or _it is so, if I am not mistaken_. This habit,I believe, has been of great advantage to me when I have had occasionto inculcate my opinions, and persuade men into measures that I havebeen from time to time engaged in promoting; and, as the chief ends ofconversation are to _inform_ or to be _informed_, to _please_ or to_persuade_, I wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen theirpower of doing good by a positive, assuming manner, that seldom failsto disgust, tends to create opposition, and to defeat everyone ofthose purposes for which speech was given to us, to wit, giving orreceiving information or pleasure. For, if you would inform, apositive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments mayprovoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention. If you wishinformation and improvement from the knowledge of others, and yet atthe same time express yourself as firmly fix'd in your presentopinions, modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation, willprobably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error. And bysuch a manner, you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in _pleasing_your hearers, or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire.Pope says, judiciously: _"Men should be taught as if you taught them not, And things unknown propos'd as things forgot;"_ farther recommending to us "To speak, tho' sure, with seeming diffidence." And he might have coupled with this line thatwhich he has coupled with another, I think,less properly, "For want of modesty is want of sense." If you ask, Why less properly? I must repeat the lines, "Immodest words admit of no defense, For want of modesty is want of sense." Now, is not _want of sense_ (where a man is so unfortunate as to wantit) some apology for his _want of modesty_? and would not the linesstand more justly thus? "Immodest words admit _but_ this defense, That want of modesty is want of sense." This, however, I should submit to better judgments. Socrates confuted his opponents in argument by asking questions so skillfully devised that the answers would confirm the questioner's position or show the error of the opponent. Alexander Pope (1688-1744), the greatest English poet of the first half of the eighteenth century. My brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper. It wasthe second that appeared in America, and was called the New EnglandCourant. The only one before it was the Boston News-Letter. I rememberhis being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking, asnot likely to succeed, one newspaper being, in their judgment, enoughfor America. At this time (1771) there are not less thanfive-and-twenty. He went on, however, with the undertaking, and afterhaving worked in composing the types and printing off the sheets, Iwas employed to carry the papers thro' the streets to the customers. Franklin's memory does not serve him correctly here. The _Courant_ was really the fifth newspaper established in America, although generally called the fourth, because the first, _Public Occurrences_, published in Boston in 1690, was suppressed after the first issue. Following is the order in which the other four papers were published: _Boston News Letter_, 1704; _Boston Gazette_, December 21, 1719; _The American Weekly Mercury_, Philadelphia, December 22, 1719; _The New England Courant_, 1721. He had some ingenious men among his friends, who amus'd themselves bywriting little pieces for this paper, which gain'd it credit and madeit more in demand, and these gentlemen often visited us. Hearing theirconversations, and their accounts of the approbation their papers werereceived with, I was excited to try my hand among them; but, beingstill a boy, and suspecting that my brother would object to printinganything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine, I contrived todisguise my hand, and, writing an anonymous paper, I put it in atnight under the door of the printing-house. It was found in themorning, and communicated to his writing friends when they call'd inas usual. They read it, commented on it in my hearing, and I had theexquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation, and that,in their different guesses at the author, none were named but men ofsome character among us for learning and ingenuity. I suppose now thatI was rather lucky in my judges, and that perhaps they were not reallyso very good ones as I then esteem'd them. Encourag'd, however, by this, I wrote and conveyed in the same way tothe press several more papers which were equally approv'd; and I keptmy secret till my small fund of sense for such performances was prettywell exhausted, and then I discovered it, when I began to beconsidered a little more by my brother's acquaintance, and in a mannerthat did not quite please him, as he thought, probably with reason,that it tended to make me too vain. And, perhaps, this might be oneoccasion of the differences that we began to have about this time.Though a brother, he considered himself as my master, and me as hisapprentice, and, accordingly, expected the same services from me as hewould from another, while I thought he demean'd me too much in some herequir'd of me, who from a brother expected more indulgence. Ourdisputes were often brought before our father, and I fancy I waseither generally in the right, or else a better pleader, because thejudgment was generally in my favor. But my brother was passionate,and had often beaten me, which I took extreamly amiss; and, thinkingmy apprenticeship very tedious, I was continually wishing for someopportunity of shortening it, which at length offered in a mannerunexpected. Disclosed. One of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point, which Ihave now forgotten, gave offense to the Assembly. He was taken up,censur'd, and imprison'd for a month, by the speaker's warrant, Isuppose, because he would not discover his author. I too was taken upand examin'd before the council; but, tho' I did not give them anysatisfaction, they contented themselves with admonishing me, anddismissed me, considering me, perhaps, as an apprentice, who was boundto keep his master's secrets. During my brother's confinement, which I resented a good deal,notwithstanding our private differences, I had the management of thepaper; and I made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it, which mybrother took very kindly, while others began to consider me in anunfavorable light, as a young genius that had a turn for libeling andsatyr. My brother's discharge was accompany'd with an order of theHouse (a very odd one), that "_James Franklin should no longer printthe paper called the New England Courant_." There was a consultation held in our printing-house among his friends,what he should do in this case. Some proposed to evade the order bychanging the name of the paper; but my brother, seeing inconveniencesin that, it was finally concluded on as a better way, to let it beprinted for the future under the name of Benjamin Franklin; and toavoid the censure of the Assembly, that might fall on him as stillprinting it by his apprentice, the contrivance was that my oldindenture should be return'd to me, with a full discharge on the backof it, to be shown on occasion, but to secure to him the benefit of myservice, I was to sign new indentures for the remainder of the term,which were to be kept private. A very flimsy scheme it was; however,it was immediately executed, and the paper went on accordingly, undermy name for several months. At length, a fresh difference arising between my brother and me, Itook upon me to assert my freedom, presuming that he would not ventureto produce the new indentures. It was not fair in me to take thisadvantage, and this I therefore reckon one of the first errata of mylife; but the unfairness of it weighed little with me, when under theimpressions of resentment for the blows his passion too often urgedhim to bestow upon me, though he was otherwise not an ill-natur'd man:perhaps I was too saucy and provoking. When he found I would leave him, he took care to prevent my gettingemployment in any other printing-house of the town, by going round andspeaking to every master, who accordingly refus'd to give me work. Ithen thought of going to New York, as the nearest place where therewas a printer; and I was rather inclin'd to leave Boston when Ireflected that I had already made myself a little obnoxious to thegoverning party, and, from the arbitrary proceedings of the Assemblyin my brother's case, it was likely I might, if I stay'd, soon bringmyself into scrapes; and farther, that my indiscreet disputationsabout religion began to make me pointed at with horror by good peopleas an infidel or atheist. I determin'd on the point, but my father nowsiding with my brother, I was sensible that, if I attempted to goopenly, means would be used to prevent me. My friend Collins,therefore, undertook to manage a little for me. He agreed with thecaptain of a New York sloop for my passage, under the notion of mybeing a young acquaintance of his. So I sold some of my books to raisea little money, was taken on board privately, and as we had a fairwind, in three days I found myself in New York, near 300 miles fromhome, a boy of but 17, without the least recommendation to, orknowledge of, any person in the place, and with very little money inmy pocket. III ARRIVAL IN PHILADELPHIA My inclinations for the sea were by this time worne out, or I mightnow have gratify'd them. But, having a trade, and supposing myself apretty good workman, I offer'd my service to the printer in the place,old Mr. William Bradford, who had been the first printer inPennsylvania, but removed from thence upon the quarrel of GeorgeKeith. He could give me no employment, having little to do, and helpenough already; but says he, "My son at Philadelphia has lately losthis principal hand, Aquilla Rose, by death; if you go thither, Ibelieve he may employ you." Philadelphia was a hundred miles further;I set out, however, in a boat for Amboy, leaving my chest and thingsto follow me round by sea. In crossing the bay, we met with a squall that tore our rotten sailsto pieces, prevented our getting into the Kill, and drove us uponLong Island. In our way, a drunken Dutchman, who was a passenger too,fell overboard; when he was sinking, I reached through the water tohis shock pate, and drew him up, so that we got him in again. Hisducking sobered him a little, and he went to sleep, taking first outof his pocket a book, which he desir'd I would dry for him. It provedto be my old favorite author, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, in Dutch,finely printed on good paper, with copper cuts, a dress better than Ihad ever seen it wear in its own language. I have since found that ithas been translated into most of the languages of Europe, and supposeit has been more generally read than any other book, except perhapsthe Bible. Honest John was the first that I know of who mix'dnarration and dialogue; a method of writing very engaging to thereader, who in the most interesting parts finds himself, as it were,brought into the company and present at the discourse. De Foe in hisCruso, his Moll Flanders, Religious Courtship, Family Instructor, andother pieces, has imitated it with success; and Richardson has donethe same in his Pamela, etc. Kill van Kull, the channel separating Staten Island from New Jersey on the north. Samuel Richardson, the father of the English novel, wrote _Pamela_, _Clarissa Harlowe_, and the _History of Sir Charles Grandison_, novels published in the form of letters. When we drew near the island, we found it was at a place where therecould be no landing, there being a great surff on the stony beach. Sowe dropt anchor, and swung round towards the shore. Some people camedown to the water edge and hallow'd to us, as we did to them; but thewind was so high, and the surff so loud, that we could not hear so asto understand each other. There were canoes on the shore, and we madesigns, and hallow'd that they should fetch us; but they either did notunderstand us, or thought it impracticable, so they went away, andnight coming on, we had no remedy but to wait till the wind shouldabate; and, in the meantime, the boatman and I concluded to sleep, ifwe could; and so crowded into the scuttle, with the Dutchman, who wasstill wet, and the spray beating over the head of our boat, leak'dthro' to us, so that we were soon almost as wet as he. In this mannerwe lay all night, with very little rest; but, the wind abating thenext day, we made a shift to reach Amboy before night, having beenthirty hours on the water, without victuals, or any drink but a bottleof filthy rum, and the water we sail'd on being salt. In the evening I found myself very feverish, and went in to bed; but,having read somewhere that cold water drank plentifully was good for afever, I follow'd the prescription, sweat plentifully most of thenight, my fever left me, and in the morning, crossing the ferry, Iproceeded on my journey on foot, having fifty miles to Burlington,where I was told I should find boats that would carry me the rest ofthe way to Philadelphia. It rained very hard all the day; I was thoroughly soak'd, and by noona good deal tired; so I stopt at a poor inn, where I staid all night,beginning now to wish that I had never left home. I cut so miserable afigure, too, that I found, by the questions ask'd me, I was suspectedto be some runaway servant, and in danger of being taken up on thatsuspicion. However, I proceeded the next day, and got in the eveningto an inn, within eight or ten miles of Burlington, kept by one Dr.Brown. He entered into conversation with me while I took somerefreshment, and, finding I had read a little, became very sociableand friendly. Our acquaintance continu'd as long as he liv'd. He hadbeen, I imagine, an itinerant doctor, for there was no town inEngland, or country in Europe, of which he could not give a veryparticular account. He had some letters, and was ingenious, but muchof an unbeliever, and wickedly undertook, some years after, totravesty the Bible in doggrel verse, as Cotton had done Virgil. Bythis means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light, andmight have hurt weak minds if his work had been published; but itnever was. At his house I lay that night, and the next morning reach'dBurlington, but had the mortification to find that the regular boatswere gone a little before my coming, and no other expected to gobefore Tuesday, this being Saturday; wherefore I returned to an oldwoman in the town, of whom I had bought gingerbread to eat on thewater, and ask'd her advice. She invited me to lodge at her house tilla passage by water should offer; and being tired with my foottraveling, I accepted the invitation. She understanding I was aprinter, would have had me stay at that town and follow my business,being ignorant of the stock necessary to begin with. She was veryhospitable, gave me a dinner of ox-cheek with great good will,accepting only of a pot of ale in return; and I thought myself fixedtill Tuesday should come. However, walking in the evening by the sideof the river, a boat came by, which I found was going towardsPhiladelphia, with several people in her. They took me in, and, asthere was no wind, we row'd all the way; and about midnight, nothaving yet seen the city, some of the company were confident we musthave passed it, and would row no farther; the others knew not where wewere; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek, landed near an oldfence, with the rails of which we made a fire, the night being cold,in October, and there we remained till daylight. Then one of thecompany knew the place to be Cooper's Creek, a little abovePhiladelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek, andarriv'd there about eight or nine o'clock on the Sunday morning, andlanded at the Market-street wharf. I have been the more particular in this description of my journey, andshall be so of my first entry into that city, that you may in yourmind compare such unlikely beginnings with the figure I have sincemade there. I was in my working dress, my best clothes being to comeround by sea. I was dirty from my journey; my pockets were stuff'd outwith shirts and stockings, and I knew no soul nor where to look forlodging. I was fatigued with traveling, rowing, and want of rest, Iwas very hungry; and my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutchdollar, and about a shilling in copper. The latter I gave the peopleof the boat for my passage, who at first refus'd it, on account of myrowing; but I insisted on their taking it. A man being sometimes moregenerous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty,perhaps thro' fear of being thought to have but little. Then I walked up the street, gazing about till near the market-house Imet a boy with bread. I had made many a meal on bread, and, inquiringwhere he got it, I went immediately to the baker's he directed me to,in Second-street, and ask'd for bisket, intending such as we had inBoston; but they, it seems, were not made in Philadelphia. Then Iasked for a three-penny loaf, and was told they had none such. So notconsidering or knowing the difference of money, and the greatercheapness nor the names of his bread, I bade him give me three-pennyworth of any sort. He gave me, accordingly, three great puffy rolls. Iwas surpris'd at the quantity, but took it, and, having no room in mypockets, walk'd off with a roll under each arm, and eating the other.Thus I went up Market-street as far as Fourth-street, passing by thedoor of Mr. Read, my future wife's father; when she, standing at thedoor, saw me, and thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward,ridiculous appearance. Then I turned and went down Chestnut-street andpart of Walnut-street, eating my roll all the way, and, coming round,found myself again at Market-street wharf, near the boat I came in, towhich I went for a draught of the river water; and, being filled withone of my rolls, gave the other two to a woman and her child that camedown the river in the boat with us, and were waiting to go farther. Thus refreshed, I walked again up the street, which by this time hadmany clean-dressed people in it, who were all walking the same way. Ijoined them, and thereby was led into the great meeting-house of theQuakers near the market. I sat down among them, and, after looking roundawhile and hearing nothing said, being very drowsy thro' labour and wantof rest the preceding night, I fell fast asleep, and continu'd so tillthe meeting broke up, when one was kind enough to rouse me. This was,therefore, the first house I was in, or slept in, in Philadelphia. Walking down again toward the river, and, looking in the faces ofpeople, I met a young Quaker man, whose countenance I lik'd, and,accosting him, requested he would tell me where a stranger could getlodging. We were then near the sign of the Three Mariners. "Here,"says he, "is one place that entertains strangers, but it is not areputable house; if thee wilt walk with me, I'll show thee a better."He brought me to the Crooked Billet in Water-street. Here I got adinner; and, while I was eating it, several sly questions were askedme, as it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance, that Imight be some runaway. After dinner, my sleepiness return'd, and being shown to a bed, I laydown without undressing, and slept till six in the evening, was call'dto supper, went to bed again very early, and slept soundly till nextmorning. Then I made myself as tidy as I could, and went to AndrewBradford the printer's. I found in the shop the old man his father,whom I had seen at New York, and who, traveling on horseback, had gotto Philadelphia before me. He introduc'd me to his son, who receiv'dme civilly, gave me a breakfast, but told me he did not at presentwant a hand, being lately suppli'd with one; but there was anotherprinter in town, lately set up, one Keimer, who, perhaps, might employme; if not, I should be welcome to lodge at his house, and he wouldgive me a little work to do now and then till fuller business shouldoffer. The old gentleman said he would go with me to the new printer; andwhen we found him, "Neighbour," says Bradford, "I have brought to seeyou a young man of your business; perhaps you may want such a one." Heask'd me a few questions, put a composing stick in my hand to see howI work'd, and then said he would employ me soon, though he had justthen nothing for me to do; and, taking old Bradford, whom he had neverseen before, to be one of the town's people that had a good will forhim, enter'd into a conversation on his present undertaking andprospects; while Bradford, not discovering that he was the otherprinter's father, on Keimer's saying he expected soon to get thegreatest part of the business into his own hands, drew him on byartful questions, and starting little doubts, to explain all hisviews, what interest he reli'd on, and in what manner he intended toproceed. I, who stood by and heard all, saw immediately that one ofthem was a crafty old sophister, and the other a mere novice. Bradfordleft me with Keimer, who was greatly surpris'd when I told him who theold man was. Keimer's printing-house, I found, consisted of an old shatter'd press,and one small, worn-out font of English, which he was then usinghimself, composing an Elegy on Aquilla Rose, before mentioned, aningenious young man, of excellent character, much respected in thetown, clerk of the Assembly, and a pretty poet. Keimer made versestoo, but very indifferently. He could not be said to write them, forhis manner was to compose them in the types directly out of his head.So there being no copy, but one pair of cases, and the Elegy likelyto require all the letter, no one could help him. I endeavour'd to puthis press (which he had not yet us'd, and of which he understoodnothing) into order fit to be work'd with; and, promising to come andprint off his Elegy as soon as he should have got it ready, Ireturn'd to Bradford's, who gave me a little job to do for thepresent, and there I lodged and dieted. A few days after, Keimer sentfor me to print off the Elegy. And now he had got another pair ofcases, and a pamphlet to reprint, on which he set me to work. These two printers I found poorly qualified for their business.Bradford had not been bred to it, and was very illiterate; and Keimer,tho' something of a scholar, was a mere compositor, knowing nothing ofpresswork. He had been one of the French prophets, and could acttheir enthusiastic agitations. At this time he did not profess anyparticular religion, but something of all on occasion; was veryignorant of the world, and had, as I afterward found, a good deal ofthe knave in his composition. He did not like my lodging at Bradford'swhile I work'd with him. He had a house, indeed, but withoutfurniture, so he could not lodge me; but he got me a lodging at Mr.Read's before mentioned, who was the owner of his house; and, my chestand clothes being come by this time, I made rather a more respectableappearance in the eyes of Miss Read than I had done when she firsthappen'd to see me eating my roll in the street. Manuscript. The frames for holding type are in two sections, the upper for capitals and the lower for small letters. Protestants of the South of France, who became fanatical under the persecutions of Louis XIV, and thought they had the gift of prophecy. They had as mottoes "No Taxes" and "Liberty of Conscience." I began now to have some acquaintance among the young people of thetown, that were lovers of reading, with whom I spent my evenings verypleasantly; and gaining money by my industry and frugality, I livedvery agreeably, forgetting Boston as much as I could, and not desiringthat any there should know where I resided, except my friend Collins,who was in my secret, and kept it when I wrote to him. At length, anincident happened that sent me back again much sooner than I hadintended. I had a brother-in-law, Robert Holmes, master of a sloopthat traded between Boston and Delaware. He being at Newcastle, fortymiles below Philadelphia, heard there of me, and wrote me a lettermentioning the concern of my friends in Boston at my abrupt departure,assuring me of their good will to me, and that everything would beaccommodated to my mind if I would return, to which he exhorted mevery earnestly. I wrote an answer to his letter, thank'd him for hisadvice, but stated my reasons for quitting Boston fully and in such alight as to convince him I was not so wrong as he had apprehended. IV FIRST VISIT TO BOSTON Sir William Keith, governor of the province, was then at Newcastle,and Captain Holmes, happening to be in company with him when my lettercame to hand, spoke to him of me, and show'd him the letter. Thegovernor read it, and seem'd surpris'd when he was told my age. Hesaid I appear'd a young man of promising parts, and therefore shouldbe encouraged; the printers at Philadelphia were wretched ones; and,if I would set up there, he made no doubt I should succeed; for hispart, he would procure me the public business, and do me every otherservice in his power. This my brother-in-law afterwards told me inBoston, but I knew as yet nothing of it; when, one day, Keimer and Ibeing at work together near the window, we saw the governor andanother gentleman (which proved to be Colonel French, of Newcastle),finely dress'd, come directly across the street to our house, andheard them at the door. Keimer ran down immediately, thinking it a visit to him; but thegovernor inquir'd for me, came up, and with a condescension andpoliteness I had been quite unus'd to, made me many compliments,desired to be acquainted with me, blam'd me kindly for not having mademyself known to him when I first came to the place, and would have meaway with him to the tavern, where he was going with Colonel French totaste, as he said, some excellent Madeira. I was not a littlesurprised, and Keimer star'd like a pig poison'd. I went, however,with the governor and Colonel French to a tavern, at the corner ofThird-street, and over the Madeira he propos'd my setting up mybusiness, laid before me the probabilities of success, and both he andColonel French assur'd me I should have their interest and influencein procuring the public business of both governments. On mydoubting whether my father would assist me in it, Sir William said hewould give me a letter to him, in which he would state the advantages,and he did not doubt of prevailing with him. So it was concluded Ishould return to Boston in the first vessel, with the governor'sletter recommending me to my father. In the meantime the intention wasto be kept a secret, and I went on working with Keimer as usual, thegovernor sending for me now and then to dine with him, a very greathonour I thought it, and conversing with me in the most affable,familiar, and friendly manner imaginable. Temple Franklin considered this specific figure vulgar and changed it to "stared with astonishment." Pennsylvania and Delaware. About the end of April, 1724, a little vessel offer'd for Boston. Itook leave of Keimer as going to see my friends. The governor gave mean ample letter, saying many flattering things of me to my father, andstrongly recommending the project of my setting up at Philadelphia asa thing that must make my fortune. We struck on a shoal in going downthe bay, and sprung a leak; we had a blustering time at sea, and wereoblig'd to pump almost continually, at which I took my turn. Wearriv'd safe, however, at Boston in about a fortnight. I had beenabsent seven months, and my friends had heard nothing of me; for mybr. Holmes was not yet return'd, and had not written about me. Myunexpected appearance surpris'd the family; all were, however, veryglad to see me, and made me welcome, except my brother. I went to seehim at his printing-house. I was better dress'd than ever while in hisservice, having a genteel new suit from head to foot, a watch, and mypockets lin'd with near five pounds sterling in silver. He receiv'd menot very frankly, look'd me all over, and turn'd to his work again. The journeymen were inquisitive where I had been, what sort of acountry it was, and how I lik'd it. I prais'd it much, and the happylife I led in it, expressing strongly my intention of returning to it;and, one of them asking what kind of money we had there, I produc'd ahandful of silver, and spread it before them, which was a kind ofraree-show they had not been us'd to, paper being the money ofBoston. Then I took an opportunity of letting them see my watch;and, lastly (my brother still grum and sullen), I gave them a pieceof eight to drink, and took my leave. This visit of mine offendedhim extreamly; for, when my mother some time after spoke to him of areconciliation, and of her wishes to see us on good terms together,and that we might live for the future as brothers, he said I hadinsulted him in such a manner before his people that he could neverforget or forgive it. In this, however, he was mistaken. A peep-show in a box. There were no mints in the colonies, so the metal money was of foreign coinage and not nearly so common as paper money, which was printed in large quantities in America, even in small denominations. Spanish dollar about equivalent to our dollar. My father received the governor's letter with some apparent surprise,but said little of it to me for some days, when Capt. Holmes returninghe show'd it to him, asked him if he knew Keith, and what kind of manhe was; adding his opinion that he must be of small discretion tothink of setting a boy up in business who wanted yet three years ofbeing at man's estate. Holmes said what he could in favour of theproject, but my father was clear in the impropriety of it, and atlast, gave a flat denial to it. Then he wrote a civil letter to SirWilliam, thanking him for the patronage he had so kindly offered me,but declining to assist me as yet in setting up, I being, in hisopinion, too young to be trusted with the management of a business soimportant, and for which the preparation must be so expensive. My friend and companion Collins, who was a clerk in the post-office,pleas'd with the account I gave him of my new country, determined togo thither also; and, while I waited for my father's determination, heset out before me by land to Rhode Island, leaving his books, whichwere a pretty collection of mathematicks and natural philosophy, tocome with mine and me to New York, where he propos'd to wait for me. My father, tho' he did not approve Sir William's proposition, was yetpleas'd that I had been able to obtain so advantageous a characterfrom a person of such note where I had resided, and that I had been soindustrious and careful as to equip myself so handsomely in so short atime; therefore, seeing no prospect of an accommodation between mybrother and me, he gave his consent to my returning again toPhiladelphia, advis'd me to behave respectfully to the people there,endeavour to obtain the general esteem, and avoid lampooning andlibeling, to which he thought I had too much inclination; telling me,that by steady industry and a prudent parsimony I might save enough bythe time I was one-and-twenty to set me up; and that, if I came nearthe matter, he would help me out with the rest. This was all I couldobtain, except some small gifts as tokens of his and my mother's love,when I embark'd again for New York, now with their approbation andtheir blessing. The sloop putting in at Newport, Rhode Island, I visited my brotherJohn, who had been married and settled there some years. He receivedme very affectionately, for he always lov'd me. A friend of his, oneVernon, having some money due to him in Pennsylvania, aboutthirty-five pounds currency, desired I would receive it for him, andkeep it till I had his directions what to remit it in. Accordingly, hegave me an order. This afterwards occasion'd me a good deal ofuneasiness. At Newport we took in a number of passengers for New York, amongwhich were two young women, companions, and a grave, sensible,matronlike Quaker woman, with her attendants. I had shown an obligingreadiness to do her some little services, which impress'd her Isuppose with a degree of good will toward me; therefore, when she sawa daily growing familiarity between me and the two young women, whichthey appear'd to encourage, she took me aside, and said, "Young man, Iam concern'd for thee, as thou hast no friend with thee, and seems notto know much of the world, or of the snares youth is expos'd to;depend upon it, those are very bad women; I can see it in all theiractions; and if thee art not upon thy guard, they will draw thee intosome danger; they are strangers to thee, and I advise thee, in afriendly concern for thy welfare, to have no acquaintance with them."As I seem'd at first not to think so ill of them as she did, shementioned some things she had observ'd and heard that had escap'd mynotice, but now convinc'd me she was right. I thank'd her for her kindadvice, and promis'd to follow it. When we arriv'd at New York, theytold me where they liv'd, and invited me to come and see them; but Iavoided it, and it was well I did; for the next day the captain miss'da silver spoon and some other things, that had been taken out of hiscabin, and, knowing that these were a couple of strumpets, he got awarrant to search their lodgings, found the stolen goods, and had thethieves punish'd. So, tho' we had escap'd a sunken rock, which wescrap'd upon in the passage, I thought this escape of rather moreimportance to me. At New York I found my friend Collins, who had arriv'd there some timebefore me. We had been intimate from children, and had read the samebooks together; but he had the advantage of more time for reading andstudying, and a wonderful genius for mathematical learning, in whichhe far outstript me. While I liv'd in Boston, most of my hours ofleisure for conversation were spent with him, and he continu'd a soberas well as an industrious lad; was much respected for his learning byseveral of the clergy and other gentlemen, and seemed to promisemaking a good figure in life. But, during my absence, he had acquir'da habit of sotting with brandy; and I found by his own account, andwhat I heard from others, that he had been drunk every day since hisarrival at New York, and behav'd very oddly. He had gam'd, too, andlost his money, so that I was oblig'd to discharge his lodgings, anddefray his expenses to and at Philadelphia, which prov'd extremelyinconvenient to me. The then governor of New York, Burnet (son of Bishop Burnet), hearingfrom the captain that a young man, one of his passengers, had a greatmany books, desir'd he would bring me to see him. I waited upon himaccordingly, and should have taken Collins with me but that he was notsober. The gov'r. treated me with great civility, show'd me hislibrary, which was a very large one, and we had a good deal ofconversation about books and authors. This was the second governor whohad done me the honour to take notice of me; which, to a poor boy likeme, was very pleasing. We proceeded to Philadelphia. I received on the way Vernon's money,without which we could hardly have finish'd our journey. Collinswished to be employ'd in some counting-house; but, whether theydiscover'd his dramming by his breath, or by his behaviour, tho' hehad some recommendations, he met with no success in any application,and continu'd lodging and boarding at the same house with me, and atmy expense. Knowing I had that money of Vernon's, he was continuallyborrowing of me, still promising repayment as soon as he should be inbusiness. At length he had got so much of it that I was distress'd tothink what I should do in case of being call'd on to remit it. His drinking continu'd, about which we sometimes quarrel'd; for, whena little intoxicated, he was very fractious. Once, in a boat on theDelaware with some other young men, he refused to row in his turn. "Iwill be row'd home," says he. "We will not row you," says I. "Youmust, or stay all night on the water," says he, "just as you please."The others said, "Let us row; what signifies it?" But, my mind beingsoured with his other conduct, I continu'd to refuse. So he swore hewould make me row, or throw me overboard; and coming along, steppingon the thwarts, toward me, when he came up and struck at me, I clappedmy hand under his crutch, and, rising, pitched him head-foremost intothe river. I knew he was a good swimmer, and so was under littleconcern about him; but before he could get round to lay hold of theboat, we had with a few strokes pull'd her out of his reach; and everwhen he drew near the boat, we ask'd if he would row, striking a fewstrokes to slide her away from him. He was ready to die withvexation, and obstinately would not promise to row. However, seeinghim at last beginning to tire, we lifted him in and brought him homedripping wet in the evening. We hardly exchang'd a civil wordafterwards, and a West India captain, who had a commission to procurea tutor for the sons of a gentleman at Barbados, happening to meetwith him, agreed to carry him thither. He left me then, promising toremit me the first money he should receive in order to discharge thedebt; but I never heard of him after. The breaking into this money of Vernon's was one of the first greaterrata of my life; and this affair show'd that my father was not muchout in his judgment when he suppos'd me too young to manage businessof importance. But Sir William, on reading his letter, said he was tooprudent. There was great difference in persons; and discretion did notalways accompany years, nor was youth always without it. "And since hewill not set you up," says he, "I will do it myself. Give me aninventory of the things necessary to be had from England, and I willsend for them. You shall repay me when you are able; I am resolv'd tohave a good printer here, and I am sure you must succeed." This wasspoken with such an appearance of cordiality, that I had not the leastdoubt of his meaning what he said. I had hitherto kept the propositionof my setting up, a secret in Philadelphia, and I still kept it. Hadit been known that I depended on the governor, probably some friend,that knew him better, would have advis'd me not to rely on him, as Iafterwards heard it as his known character to be liberal of promiseswhich he never meant to keep. Yet, unsolicited as he was by me, howcould I think his generous offers insincere? I believ'd him one of thebest men in the world. I presented him an inventory of a little print'-house, amounting by mycomputation to about one hundred pounds sterling. He lik'd it, butask'd me if my being on the spot in England to chuse the types, andsee that everything was good of the kind, might not be of someadvantage. "Then," says he, "when there, you may make acquaintances,and establish correspondences in the bookselling and stationery way."I agreed that this might be advantageous. "Then," says he, "getyourself ready to go with Annis;" which was the annual ship, and theonly one at that time usually passing between London and Philadelphia.But it would be some months before Annis sail'd, so I continuedworking with Keimer, fretting about the money Collins had got from me,and in daily apprehensions of being call'd upon by Vernon, which,however, did not happen for some years after. I believe I have omitted mentioning that, in my first voyage fromBoston, being becalm'd off Block Island, our people set about catchingcod, and hauled up a great many. Hitherto I had stuck to my resolutionof not eating animal food, and on this occasion I consider'd, with mymaster Tryon, the taking every fish as a kind of unprovoked murder,since none of them had, or ever could do us any injury that mightjustify the slaughter. All this seemed very reasonable. But I hadformerly been a great lover of fish, and, when this came hot out ofthe frying-pan, it smelt admirably well. I balanc'd some time betweenprinciple and inclination, till I recollected that, when the fish wereopened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thoughtI, "If you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you." So Idin'd upon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people,returning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet. Soconvenient a thing is it to be a _reasonable creature_, since itenables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind todo. V EARLY FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA Keimer and I liv'd on a pretty good familiar footing, and agreedtolerably well, for he suspected nothing of my setting up. He retaineda great deal of his old enthusiasms and lov'd argumentation. Wetherefore had many disputations. I used to work him so with mySocratic method, and had trepann'd him so often by questionsapparently so distant from any point we had in hand, and yet bydegrees led to the point, and brought him into difficulties andcontradictions, that at last he grew ridiculously cautious, and wouldhardly answer me the most common question, without asking first,"_What do you intend to infer from that_?" However, it gave him sohigh an opinion of my abilities in the confuting way, that heseriously proposed my being his colleague in a project he had ofsetting up a new sect. He was to preach the doctrines, and I was toconfound all opponents. When he came to explain with me upon thedoctrines, I found several conundrums which I objected to, unless Imight have my way a little too, and introduce some of mine. Keimer wore his beard at full length, because somewhere in the Mosaiclaw it is said, "_Thou shalt not mar the corners of thy beard_." Helikewise kept the Seventh day, Sabbath; and these two points wereessentials with him. I dislik'd both; but agreed to admit them uponcondition of his adopting the doctrine of using no animal food. "Idoubt," said he, "my constitution will not bear that." I assur'd himit would, and that he would be the better for it. He was usually agreat glutton, and I promised myself some diversion in half starvinghim. He agreed to try the practice, if I would keep him company. I didso, and we held it for three months. We had our victuals dress'd, andbrought to us regularly by a woman in the neighborhood, who had fromme a list of forty dishes, to be prepar'd for us at different times,in all which there was neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, and the whimsuited me the better at this time from the cheapness of it, notcosting us above eighteenpence sterling each per week. I have sincekept several Lents most strictly, leaving the common diet for that,and that for the common, abruptly, without the least inconvenience, sothat I think there is little in the advice of making those changes byeasy gradations. I went on pleasantly, but poor Keimer sufferedgrievously, tired of the project, long'd for the flesh-pots of Egypt,and order'd a roast pig. He invited me and two women friends to dinewith him; but, it being brought too soon upon table, he could notresist the temptation, and ate the whole before we came. I had made some courtship during this time to Miss Read. I had a greatrespect and affection for her, and had some reason to believe she hadthe same for me; but, as I was about to take a long voyage, and wewere both very young, only a little above eighteen, it was thoughtmost prudent by her mother to prevent our going too far at present, asa marriage, if it was to take place, would be more convenient after myreturn, when I should be, as I expected, set up in my business.Perhaps, too, she thought my expectations not so well founded as Iimagined them to be. My chief acquaintances at this time were Charles Osborne, JosephWatson, and James Ralph, all lovers of reading. The two first wereclerks to an eminent scrivener or conveyancer in the town, CharlesBrockden; the other was clerk to a merchant. Watson was a pious,sensible young man, of great integrity; the others rather more lax intheir principles of religion, particularly Ralph, who, as well asCollins, had been unsettled by me, for which they both made me suffer.Osborne was sensible, candid, frank; sincere and affectionate to hisfriends; but, in literary matters, too fond of criticizing. Ralph wasingenious, genteel in his manners, and extremely eloquent; I think Inever knew a prettier talker. Both of them were great admirers ofpoetry, and began to try their hands in little pieces. Many pleasantwalks we four had together on Sundays into the woods, nearSchuylkill, where we read to one another, and conferr'd on what weread. Ralph was inclin'd to pursue the study of poetry, not doubting but hemight become eminent in it, and make his fortune by it, alleging thatthe best poets must, when they first began to write, make as manyfaults as he did. Osborne dissuaded him, assur'd him he had no geniusfor poetry, and advis'd him to think of nothing beyond the business hewas bred to; that, in the mercantile way, tho' he had no stock, hemight, by his diligence and punctuality, recommend himself toemployment as a factor, and in time acquire wherewith to trade on hisown account. I approv'd the amusing one's self with poetry now andthen, so far as to improve one's language, but no farther. On this it was propos'd that we should each of us, at our nextmeeting, produce a piece of our own composing, in order to improve byour mutual observations, criticisms, and corrections. As language andexpression were what we had in view, we excluded all considerations ofinvention by agreeing that the task should be a version of theeighteenth Psalm, which describes the descent of a Deity. When thetime of our meeting drew nigh, Ralph called on me first, and let meknow his piece was ready. I told him I had been busy, and, havinglittle inclination, had done nothing. He then show'd me his piece formy opinion, and I much approv'd it, as it appear'd to me to have greatmerit. "Now," says he, "Osborne never will allow the least merit inanything of mine, but makes 1000 criticisms out of mere envy. He isnot so jealous of you; I wish, therefore, you would take this piece,and produce it as yours; I will pretend not to have had time, and soproduce nothing. We shall then see what he will say to it." It wasagreed, and I immediately transcrib'd it, that it might appear in myown hand. We met; Watson's performance was read; there were some beauties in it,but many defects. Osborne's was read; it was much better; Ralph did itjustice; remarked some faults, but applauded the beauties. He himselfhad nothing to produce. I was backward; seemed desirous of beingexcused; had not had sufficient time to correct, etc.; but no excusecould be admitted; produce I must. It was read and repeated; Watsonand Osborne gave up the contest, and join'd in applauding it. Ralphonly made some criticisms, and propos'd some amendments; but Idefended my text. Osborne was against Ralph, and told him he was nobetter a critic than poet, so he dropt the argument. As they two wenthome together, Osborne expressed himself still more strongly in favorof what he thought my production; having restrain'd himself before, ashe said, lest I should think it flattery. "But who would haveimagin'd," said he, "that Franklin had been capable of such aperformance; such painting, such force, such fire! He has evenimprov'd the original. In his common conversation he seems to have nochoice of words; he hesitates and blunders; and yet, good God! how hewrites!" When we next met, Ralph discovered the trick we had plaidhim, and Osborne was a little laughed at. This transaction fixed Ralph in his resolution of becoming a poet. Idid all I could to dissuade him from it, but he continued scribblingverses till _Pope_ cured him. He became, however, a pretty goodprose writer. More of him hereafter. But, as I may not have occasionagain to mention the other two, I shall just remark here, that Watsondied in my arms a few years after, much lamented, being the best ofour set. Osborne went to the West Indies, where he became an eminentlawyer and made money, but died young. He and I had made a seriousagreement, that the one who happen'd first to die should, if possible,make a friendly visit to the other, and acquaint him how he foundthings in that separate state. But he never fulfill'd his promise. "In one of the later editions of the _Dunciad_ occur the following lines: 'Silence, ye wolves! while Ralph to Cynthia howls, And makes night hideous--answer him, ye owls.' To this the poet adds the following note: 'James Ralph, a name inserted after the first editions, not known till he writ a swearing-piece called _Sawney_, very abusive of Dr. Swift, Mr. Gay, and myself.'" VI FIRST VISIT TO LONDON The governor, seeming to like my company, had me frequently to hishouse, and his setting me up was always mention'd as a fixed thing. Iwas to take with me letters recommendatory to a number of his friends,besides the letter of credit to furnish me with the necessary moneyfor purchasing the press and types, paper, etc. For these letters Iwas appointed to call at different times, when they were to be ready;but a future time was still named. Thus he went on till the ship,whose departure too had been several times postponed, was on the pointof sailing. Then, when I call'd to take my leave and receive theletters, his secretary, Dr. Bard, came out to me and said the governorwas extremely busy in writing, but would be down at Newcastle, beforethe ship, and there the letters would be delivered to me. Ralph, though married, and having one child, had determined toaccompany me in this voyage. It was thought he intended to establish acorrespondence, and obtain goods to sell on commission; but I foundafterwards, that, thro' some discontent with his wife's relations, hepurposed to leave her on their hands, and never return again. Havingtaken leave of my friends, and interchang'd some promises with MissRead, I left Philadelphia in the ship, which anchor'd at Newcastle.The governor was there; but when I went to his lodging, the secretarycame to me from him with the civillest message in the world, that hecould not then see me, being engaged in business of the utmostimportance, but should send the letters to me on board, wished meheartily a good voyage and a speedy return, etc. I returned on board alittle puzzled, but still not doubting. Mr. Andrew Hamilton, a famous lawyer of Philadelphia, had takenpassage in the same ship for himself and son, and with Mr. Denham, aQuaker merchant, and Messrs. Onion and Russel, masters of an iron workin Maryland, had engaged the great cabin; so that Ralph and I wereforced to take up with a berth in the steerage, and none on boardknowing us, were considered as ordinary persons. But Mr. Hamilton andhis son (it was James, since governor) return'd from Newcastle toPhiladelphia, the father being recall'd by a great fee to plead for aseized ship; and, just before we sail'd, Colonel French coming onboard, and showing me great respect, I was more taken notice of, and,with my friend Ralph, invited by the other gentlemen to come into thecabin, there being now room. Accordingly, we remov'd thither. Understanding that Colonel French had brought on board the governor'sdespatches, I ask'd the captain for those letters that were to beunder my care. He said all were put into the bag together and he couldnot then come at them; but, before we landed in England, I should havean opportunity of picking them out; so I was satisfied for thepresent, and we proceeded on our voyage. We had a sociable company inthe cabin, and lived uncommonly well, having the addition of all Mr.Hamilton's stores, who had laid in plentifully. In this passage Mr.Denham contracted a friendship for me that continued during his life.The voyage was otherwise not a pleasant one, as we had a great deal ofbad weather. When we came into the Channel, the captain kept his word with me, andgave me an opportunity of examining the bag for the governor'sletters. I found none upon which my name was put as under my care. Ipicked out six or seven, that, by the handwriting, I thought might bethe promised letters, especially as one of them was directed toBasket, the king's printer, and another to some stationer. We arriv'din London the 24th of December, 1724. I waited upon the stationer, whocame first in my way, delivering the letter as from Governor Keith. "Idon't know such a person," says he; but, opening the letter, "O! thisis from Riddlesden. I have lately found him to be a compleat rascal,and I will have nothing to do with him, nor receive any letters fromhim." So, putting the letter into my hand, he turn'd on his heel andleft me to serve some customer. I was surprized to find these were notthe governor's letters; and, after recollecting and comparingcircumstances, I began to doubt his sincerity. I found my friendDenham, and opened the whole affair to him. He let me into Keith'scharacter; told me there was not the least probability that he hadwritten any letters for me; that no one, who knew him, had thesmallest dependence on him; and he laught at the notion of thegovernor's giving me a letter of credit, having, as he said, no creditto give. On my expressing some concern about what I should do, headvised me to endeavour getting some employment in the way of mybusiness. "Among the printers here," said he, "you will improveyourself, and when you return to America, you will set up to greateradvantage." We both of us happen'd to know, as well as the stationer, thatRiddlesden, the attorney, was a very knave. He had half ruin'd MissRead's father by persuading him to be bound for him. By this letter itappear'd there was a secret scheme on foot to the prejudice ofHamilton (suppos'd to be then coming over with us); and that Keith wasconcerned in it with Riddlesden. Denham, who was a friend ofHamilton's, thought he ought to be acquainted with it; so, when hearriv'd in England, which was soon after, partly from resentment andill-will to Keith and Riddlesden, and partly from good-will to him, Iwaited on him, and gave him the letter. He thank'd me cordially, theinformation being of importance to him; and from that time he becamemy friend, greatly to my advantage afterwards on many occasions. But what shall we think of a governor's playing such pitiful tricks,and imposing so grossly on a poor ignorant boy! It was a habit he hadacquired. He wish'd to please everybody; and, having little to give,he gave expectations. He was otherwise an ingenious, sensible man, apretty good writer, and a good governor for the people, tho' not forhis constituents, the proprietaries, whose instructions he sometimesdisregarded. Several of our best laws were of his planning and passedduring his administration. Ralph and I were inseparable companions. We took lodgings together inLittle Britain at three shillings and sixpence a week--as much aswe could then afford. He found some relations, but they were poor, andunable to assist him. He now let me know his intentions of remainingin London, and that he never meant to return to Philadelphia. He hadbrought no money with him, the whole he could muster having beenexpended in paying his passage. I had fifteen pistoles; so heborrowed occasionally of me to subsist, while he was looking out forbusiness. He first endeavoured to get into the play-house, believinghimself qualify'd for an actor; but Wilkes, to whom he apply'd,advis'd him candidly not to think of that employment, as it wasimpossible he should succeed in it. Then he propos'd to Roberts, apublisher in Paternoster Row, to write for him a weekly paper likethe Spectator, on certain conditions, which Roberts did not approve.Then he endeavoured to get employment as a hackney writer, to copy forthe stationers and lawyers about the Temple, but could find novacancy. One of the oldest parts of London, north of St. Paul's Cathedral, called "Little Britain" because the Dukes of Brittany used to live there. See the essay entitled "Little Britain" in Washington Irving's _Sketch Book_. A gold coin worth about four dollars in our money. A popular comedian, manager of Drury Lane Theater. Street north of St. Paul's, occupied by publishing houses. Law schools and lawyers' residences situated southwest of St. Paul's, between Fleet Street and the Thames. I immediately got into work at Palmer's, then a famous printing-housein Bartholomew Close, and here I continu'd near a year. I was prettydiligent, but spent with Ralph a good deal of my earnings in going toplays and other places of amusement. We had together consumed all mypistoles, and now just rubbed on from hand to mouth. He seem'd quiteto forget his wife and child, and I, by degrees, my engagements withMiss Read, to whom I never wrote more than one letter, and that was tolet her know I was not likely soon to return. This was another of thegreat errata of my life, which I should wish to correct if I were tolive it over again. In fact, by our expenses, I was constantly keptunable to pay my passage. At Palmer's I was employed in composing for the second edition ofWollaston's "Religion of Nature." Some of his reasonings not appearingto me well founded, I wrote a little metaphysical piece in which Imade remarks on them. It was entitled "A Dissertation on Liberty andNecessity, Pleasure and Pain." I inscribed it to my friend Ralph; Iprinted a small number. It occasion'd my being more consider'd by Mr.Palmer as a young man of some ingenuity, tho' he seriouslyexpostulated with me upon the principles of my pamphlet, which to himappear'd abominable. My printing this pamphlet was another erratum. While I lodg'd in Little Britain, I made an acquaintance with oneWilcox, a bookseller, whose shop was at the next door. He had animmense collection of second-hand books. Circulating libraries werenot then in use; but we agreed that, on certain reasonable terms,which I have now forgotten, I might take, read, and return any of hisbooks. This I esteem'd a great advantage, and I made as much use of itas I could. My pamphlet by some means falling into the hands of one Lyons, asurgeon, author of a book entitled "The Infallibility of HumanJudgment," it occasioned an acquaintance between us. He took greatnotice of me, called on me often to converse on those subjects,carried me to the Horns, a pale alehouse in----Lane, Cheapside,and introduced me to Dr. Mandeville, author of the "Fable of theBees," who had a club there, of which he was the soul, being a mostfacetious, entertaining companion. Lyons, too, introduced me to Dr.Pemberton, at Batson's Coffee-house, who promis'd to give me anopportunity, sometime or other, of seeing Sir Isaac Newton, of which Iwas extreamly desirous; but this never happened. I had brought over a few curiosities, among which the principal was apurse made of the asbestos, which purifies by fire. Sir Hans Sloaneheard of it, came to see me, and invited me to his house in BloomsburySquare, where he show'd me all his curiosities, and persuaded me tolet him add that to the number, for which he paid me handsomely. In our house there lodg'd a young woman, a milliner, who, I think, hada shop in the Cloisters. She had been genteelly bred, was sensible andlively, and of most pleasing conversation. Ralph read plays to her inthe evenings, they grew intimate, she took another lodging, and hefollowed her. They liv'd together some time; but, he being still outof business, and her income not sufficient to maintain them with herchild, he took a resolution of going from London, to try for a countryschool, which he thought himself well qualified to undertake, as hewrote an excellent hand, and was a master of arithmetic and accounts.This, however, he deemed a business below him, and confident of futurebetter fortune, when he should be unwilling to have it known that heonce was so meanly employed, he changed his name, and did me thehonour to assume mine; for I soon after had a letter from him,acquainting me that he was settled in a small village (in Berkshire, Ithink it was, where he taught reading and writing to ten or a dozenboys, at sixpence each per week), recommending Mrs. T---- to my care,and desiring me to write to him, directing for Mr. Franklin,schoolmaster, at such a place. He continued to write frequently, sending me large specimens of anepic poem which he was then composing, and desiring my remarks andcorrections. These I gave him from time to time, but endeavour'drather to discourage his proceeding. One of Young's Satires wasthen just published. I copy'd and sent him a great part of it, whichset in a strong light the folly of pursuing the Muses with any hope ofadvancement by them. All was in vain; sheets of the poem continued tocome by every post. In the meantime, Mrs. T----, having on his accountlost her friends and business, was often in distresses, and us'd tosend for me and borrow what I could spare to help her out of them. Igrew fond of her company, and, being at that time under no religiousrestraint, and presuming upon my importance to her, I attemptedfamiliarities (another erratum) which she repuls'd with a properresentment, and acquainted him with my behaviour. This made a breachbetween us; and, when he returned again to London, he let me know hethought I had cancell'd all the obligations he had been under to me.So I found I was never to expect his repaying me what I lent to him oradvanc'd for him. This, however, was not then of much consequence, ashe was totally unable; and in the loss of his friendship I foundmyself relieved from a burthen. I now began to think of getting alittle money beforehand, and, expecting better work, I left Palmer'sto work at Watts's, near Lincoln's Inn Fields, a still greaterprinting-house. Here I continued all the rest of my stay in London. Edward Young (1681-1765), an English poet. See his satires, Vol. III, Epist. ii, page 70. The printing press at which Franklin worked is preserved in the Patent Office at Washington. At my first admission into this printing-house I took to working atpress, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I had been us'dto in America, where presswork is mix'd with composing. I drank onlywater; the other workmen, near fifty in number, were great guzzlers ofbeer. On occasion, I carried up and down stairs a large form of typesin each hand, when others carried but one in both hands. They wonderedto see, from this and several instances, that the _Water-American_, asthey called me, was _stronger_ than themselves, who drank _strong_beer! We had an alehouse boy who attended always in the house tosupply the workmen. My companion at the press drank every day a pintbefore breakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, apint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint in theafternoon about six o'clock, and another when he had done his day'swork. I thought it a detestable custom; but it was necessary, hesuppos'd, to drink _strong_ beer, that he might be _strong_ to labour.I endeavoured to convince him that the bodily strength afforded bybeer could only be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barleydissolved in the water of which it was made; that there was more flourin a pennyworth of bread; and therefore, if he would eat that with apint of water, it would give him more strength than a quart of beer.He drank on, however, and had four or five shillings to pay out of hiswages every Saturday night for that muddling liquor; an expense I wasfree from. And thus these poor devils keep themselves always under. Watts, after some weeks, desiring to have me in the composing-room,I left the pressmen; a new bien venu or sum for drink, being fiveshillings, was demanded of me by the compositors. I thought it animposition, as I had paid below; the master thought so too, and forbademy paying it. I stood out two or three weeks, was accordingly consideredas an excommunicate, and had so many little pieces of private mischiefdone me, by mixing my sorts, transposing my pages, breaking my matter,etc., etc., if I were ever so little out of the room, and all ascribedto the chappel ghost, which they said ever haunted those not regularlyadmitted, that, notwithstanding the master's protection, I found myselfoblig'd to comply and pay the money, convinc'd of the folly of being onill terms with those one is to live with continually. Franklin now left the work of operating the printing presses, which was largely a matter of manual labor, and began setting type, which required more skill and intelligence. I was now on a fair footing with them, and soon acquir'd considerableinfluence. I propos'd some reasonable alterations in their chappellaws, and carried them against all opposition. From my example, agreat part of them left their muddling breakfast of beer, and bread,and cheese, finding they could with me be supply'd from a neighbouringhouse with a large porringer of hot water-gruel, sprinkled withpepper, crumb'd with bread, and a bit of butter in it, for the priceof a pint of beer, viz., three half-pence. This was a more comfortableas well as cheaper breakfast, and keep their heads clearer. Those whocontinued sotting with beer all day, were often, by not paying, out ofcredit at the alehouse, and us'd to make interest with me to get beer;their _light_, as they phrased it, _being out_. I watch'd thepay-table on Saturday night, and collected what I stood engag'd forthem, having to pay sometimes near thirty shillings a week on theiraccounts. This, and my being esteem'd a pretty good _riggite_, thatis, a jocular verbal satirist, supported my consequence in thesociety. My constant attendance (I never making a St. Monday)recommended me to the master; and my uncommon quickness at composingoccasioned my being put upon all work of dispatch, which was generallybetter paid. So I went on now very agreeably. A printing house is called a chapel because Caxton, the first English printer, did his printing in a chapel connected with Westminster Abbey. A holiday taken to prolong the dissipation of Saturday's wages. My lodging in Little Britain being too remote, I found another inDuke-street, opposite to the Romish Chapel. It was two pair of stairsbackwards, at an Italian warehouse. A widow lady kept the house; shehad a daughter, and a maid servant, and a journeyman who attended thewarehouse, but lodg'd abroad. After sending to inquire my character atthe house where I last lodg'd she agreed to take me in at the samerate, 3s. 6d. per week; cheaper, as she said, from the protection sheexpected in having a man lodge in the house. She was a widow, anelderly woman; had been bred a Protestant, being a clergyman'sdaughter, but was converted to the Catholic religion by her husband,whose memory she much revered; had lived much among people ofdistinction, and knew a thousand anecdotes of them as far back as thetimes of Charles the Second. She was lame in her knees with the gout,and, therefore, seldom stirred out of her room, so sometimes wantedcompany; and hers was so highly amusing to me, that I was sure tospend an evening with her whenever she desired it. Our supper wasonly half an anchovy each, on a very little strip of bread and butter,and half a pint of ale between us; but the entertainment was in herconversation. My always keeping good hours, and giving little troublein the family, made her unwilling to part with me, so that, when Italk'd of a lodging I had heard of, nearer my business, for twoshillings a week, which, intent as I now was on saving money, madesome difference, she bid me not think of it, for she would abate metwo shillings a week for the future; so I remained with her at oneshilling and sixpence as long as I staid in London. In a garret of her house there lived a maiden lady of seventy, in themost retired manner, of whom my landlady gave me this account: thatshe was a Roman Catholic, had been sent abroad when young, and lodg'din a nunnery with an intent of becoming a nun; but, the country notagreeing with her, she returned to England, where, there being nonunnery, she had vow'd to lead the life of a nun, as near as might bedone in those circumstances. Accordingly, she had given all her estateto charitable uses, reserving only twelve pounds a year to live on,and out of this sum she still gave a great deal in charity, livingherself on water-gruel only, and using no fire but to boil it. She hadlived many years in that garret, being permitted to remain theregratis by successive Catholic tenants of the house below, as theydeemed it a blessing to have her there. A priest visited her toconfess her every day. "I have ask'd her," says my landlady, "how she,as she liv'd, could possibly find so much employment for a confessor?""Oh," said she, "it is impossible to avoid _vain thoughts_." I waspermitted once to visit her. She was cheerful and polite, andconvers'd pleasantly. The room was clean, but had no other furniturethan a matras, a table with a crucifix and book, a stool which shegave me to sit on, and a picture over the chimney of Saint Veronicadisplaying her handkerchief, with the miraculous figure of Christ'sbleeding face on it, which she explained to me with greatseriousness. She look'd pale, but was never sick; and I give it asanother instance on how small an income, life and health may besupported. At Watts's printing-house I contracted an acquaintance with aningenious young man, one Wygate, who, having wealthy relations, hadbeen better educated than most printers; was a tolerable Latinist,spoke French, and lov'd reading. I taught him and a friend of his toswim at twice going into the river, and they soon became goodswimmers. They introduc'd me to some gentlemen from the country, whowent to Chelsea by water to see the College and Don Saltero'scuriosities. In our return, at the request of the company, whosecuriosity Wygate had excited, I stripped and leaped into the river,and swam from near Chelsea to Blackfriar's, performing on the waymany feats of activity, both upon and under water, that surpris'd andpleas'd those to whom they were novelties. The story is that she met Christ on His way to crucifixion and offered Him her handkerchief to wipe the blood from His face, after which the handkerchief always bore the image of Christ's bleeding face. James Salter, a former servant of Hans Sloane, lived in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. "His house, a barber-shop, was known as 'Don Saltero's Coffee-House.' The curiosities were in glass cases and constituted an amazing and motley collection--a petrified crab from China, a 'lignified hog,' Job's tears, Madagascar lances, William the Conqueror's flaming sword, and Henry the Eighth's coat of mail."--Smyth. About three miles. I had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise, had studiedand practis'd all Thevenot's motions and positions, added some of myown, aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the useful. All theseI took this occasion of exhibiting to the company, and was muchflatter'd by their admiration; and Wygate, who was desirous ofbecoming a master, grew more and more attach'd to me on that account,as well as from the similarity of our studies. He at length proposedto me traveling all over Europe together, supporting ourselveseverywhere by working at our business. I was once inclined to it; but,mentioning it to my good friend Mr. Denham, with whom I often spent anhour when I had leisure, he dissuaded me from it, advising me to thinkonly of returning to Pennsylvania, which he was now about to do. I must record one trait of this good man's character. He had formerlybeen in business at Bristol, but failed in debt to a number of people,compounded and went to America. There, by a close application tobusiness as a merchant, he acquired a plentiful fortune in a fewyears. Returning to England in the ship with me, he invited his oldcreditors to an entertainment, at which he thank'd them for the easycomposition they had favoured him with, and, when they expectednothing but the treat, every man at the first remove found under hisplate an order on a banker for the full amount of the unpaidremainder with interest. He now told me he was about to return to Philadelphia, and shouldcarry over a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there.He propos'd to take me over as his clerk, to keep his books, in whichhe would instruct me, copy his letters, and attend the store. Headded, that, as soon as I should be acquainted with mercantilebusiness, he would promote me by sending me with a cargo of flour andbread, etc., to the West Indies, and procure me commissions fromothers which would be profitable; and, if I manag'd well, wouldestablish me handsomely. The thing pleas'd me; for I was grown tiredof London, remembered with pleasure the happy months I had spent inPennsylvania, and wish'd again to see it; therefore I immediatelyagreed on the terms of fifty pounds a year, Pennsylvania money;less, indeed, than my present gettings as a compositor, but affordinga better prospect. About $167. I now took leave of printing, as I thought, forever, and was dailyemployed in my new business, going about with Mr. Denham among thetradesmen to purchase various articles, and seeing them pack'd up,doing errands, calling upon workmen to dispatch, etc.; and, when allwas on board, I had a few days' leisure. On one of these days, I was,to my surprise, sent for by a great man I knew only by name, a SirWilliam Wyndham, and I waited upon him. He had heard by some means orother of my swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriars, and of my teachingWygate and another young man to swim in a few hours. He had two sons,about to set out on their travels; he wish'd to have them first taughtswimming, and proposed to gratify me handsomely if I would teach them.They were not yet come to town, and my stay was uncertain, so I couldnot undertake it; but, from this incident, I thought it likely that,if I were to remain in England and open a swimming-school, I might geta good deal of money; and it struck me so strongly, that, had theoverture been sooner made me, probably I should not so soon havereturned to America. After many years, you and I had something of moreimportance to do with one of these sons of Sir William Wyndham,become Earl of Egremont, which I shall mention in its place. Thus I spent about eighteen months in London; most part of the time Iwork'd hard at my business, and spent but little upon myself except inseeing plays and in books. My friend Ralph had kept me poor; he owedme about twenty-seven pounds, which I was now never likely to receive;a great sum out of my small earnings! I lov'd him, notwithstanding,for he had many amiable qualities. I had by no means improv'd myfortune; but I had picked up some very ingenious acquaintance, whoseconversation was of great advantage to me; and I had readconsiderably. VII BEGINNING BUSINESS INPHILADELPHIA We sail'd from Gravesend on the 23rd of July, 1726. For the incidentsof the voyage, I refer you to my Journal, where you will find them allminutely related. Perhaps the most important part of that journal isthe _plan_ to be found in it, which I formed at sea, forregulating my future conduct in life. It is the more remarkable, asbeing formed when I was so young, and yet being pretty faithfullyadhered to quite thro' to old age. "Not found in the manuscript journal, which was left among Franklin's papers."--Bigelow. We landed in Philadelphia on the 11th of October, where I found sundryalterations. Keith was no longer governor, being superseded by MajorGordon. I met him walking the streets as a common citizen. He seem'd alittle asham'd at seeing me, but pass'd without saying anything. Ishould have been as much asham'd at seeing Miss Read, had not herfriends, despairing with reason of my return after the receipt of myletter, persuaded her to marry another, one Rogers, a potter, whichwas done in my absence. With him, however, she was never happy, andsoon parted from him, refusing to cohabit with him or bear his name,it being now said that he had another wife. He was a worthless fellow,tho' an excellent workman, which was the temptation to her friends. Hegot into debt, ran away in 1727 or 1728, went to the West Indies, anddied there. Keimer had got a better house, a shop well supply'd withstationery, plenty of new types, a number of hands, tho' none good,and seem'd to have a great deal of business. Mr. Denham took a store in Water-street, where we open'd our goods; Iattended the business diligently, studied accounts, and grew, in alittle time, expert at selling. We lodg'd and boarded together; hecounsell'd me as a father, having a sincere regard for me. I respectedand loved him, and we might have gone on together very happy; but, inthe beginning of February, 1726/7, when I had just pass'd mytwenty-first year, we both were taken ill. My distemper was apleurisy, which very nearly carried me off. I suffered a good deal,gave up the point in my own mind, and was rather disappointed when Ifound myself recovering, regretting, in some degree, that I must now,some time or other, have all that disagreeable work to do over again.I forget what his distemper was; it held him a long time, and atlength carried him off. He left me a small legacy in a nuncupativewill, as a token of his kindness for me, and he left me once more tothe wide world; for the store was taken into the care of hisexecutors, and my employment under him ended. My brother-in-law, Holmes, being now at Philadelphia, advised myreturn to my business; and Keimer tempted me, with an offer of largewages by the year, to come and take the management of hisprinting-house, that he might better attend his stationer's shop. Ihad heard a bad character of him in London from his wife and herfriends, and was not fond of having any more to do with him. I tri'dfor farther employment as a merchant's clerk; but, not readily meetingwith any, I clos'd again with Keimer. I found in his house thesehands: Hugh Meredith, a Welsh Pennsylvanian, thirty years of age, bredto country work; honest, sensible, had a great deal of solidobservation, was something of a reader, but given to drink. StephenPotts, a young countryman of full age, bred to the same, of uncommonnatural parts, and great wit and humor, but a little idle. These hehad agreed with at extream low wages per week to be rais'd a shillingevery three months, as they would deserve by improving in theirbusiness; and the expectation of these high wages, to come onhereafter, was what he had drawn them in with. Meredith was to work atpress, Potts at book-binding, which he, by agreement, was to teachthem, though he knew neither one nor t'other. John----, a wildIrishman, brought up to no business, whose service, for fouryears, Keimer had purchased from the captain of a ship; he, too, wasto be made a pressman. George Webb, an Oxford scholar, whose time forfour years he had likewise bought, intending him for a compositor, ofwhom more presently; and David Harry, a country boy, whom he had takenapprentice. I soon perceiv'd that the intention of engaging me at wages so muchhigher than he had been us'd to give, was, to have these raw, cheaphands form'd thro' me; and, as soon as I had instructed them, thenthey being all articled to him, he should be able to do without me. Iwent on, however, very chearfully, put his printing-house in order,which had been in great confusion, and brought his hands by degrees tomind their business and to do it better. It was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situation of abought servant. He was not more than eighteen years of age, and gaveme this account of himself; that he was born in Gloucester, educatedat a grammar-school there, had been distinguish'd among the scholarsfor some apparent superiority in performing his part, when theyexhibited plays; belong'd to the Witty Club there, and had writtensome pieces in prose and verse, which were printed in the Gloucesternewspapers; thence he was sent to Oxford; where he continued about ayear, but not well satisfi'd, wishing of all things to see London, andbecome a player. At length, receiving his quarterly allowance offifteen guineas, instead of discharging his debts he walk'd out oftown, hid his gown in a furze bush, and footed it to London, where,having no friend to advise him, he fell into bad company, soon spenthis guineas, found no means of being introduc'd among the players,grew necessitous, pawn'd his cloaths, and wanted bread. Walking thestreet very hungry, and not knowing what to do with himself, a crimp'sbill was put into his hand, offering immediate entertainment andencouragement to such as would bind themselves to serve in America. Hewent directly, sign'd the indentures, was put into the ship, and cameover, never writing a line to acquaint his friends what was become ofhim. He was lively, witty, good-natur'd, and a pleasant companion, butidle, thoughtless, and imprudent to the last degree. A crimp was the agent of a shipping company. Crimps were sometimes employed to decoy men into such service as is here mentioned. John, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to live veryagreeably, for they all respected me the more, as they found Keimerincapable of instructing them, and that from me they learned somethingdaily. We never worked on Saturday, that being Keimer's Sabbath, so Ihad two days for reading. My acquaintance with ingenious people in thetown increased. Keimer himself treated me with great civility andapparent regard, and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon,which I was yet unable to pay, being hitherto but a poor æconomist.He, however, kindly made no demand of it. Our printing-house often wanted sorts, and there was no letter-founderin America; I had seen types cast at James's in London, but withoutmuch attention to the manner; however, I now contrived a mould, madeuse of the letters we had as puncheons, struck the mattrices in lead,and thus supply'd in a pretty tolerable way all deficiencies. I alsoengrav'd several things on occasion; I made the ink; I waswarehouseman, and everything, and, in short, quite a fac-totum. But, however serviceable I might be, I found that my services becameevery day of less importance, as the other hands improv'd in thebusiness; and, when Keimer paid my second quarter's wages, he let meknow that he felt them too heavy, and thought I should make anabatement. He grew by degrees less civil, put on more of the master,frequently found fault, was captious, and seem'd ready for anoutbreaking. I went on, nevertheless, with a good deal of patience,thinking that his encumber'd circumstances were partly the cause. Atlength a trifle snapt our connections; for, a great noise happeningnear the court-house, I put my head out of the window to see what wasthe matter. Keimer, being in the street, look'd up and saw me, call'dout to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business, addingsome reproachful words, that nettled me the more for their publicity,all the neighbours who were looking out on the same occasion beingwitnesses how I was treated. He came up immediately into theprinting-house, continu'd the quarrel, high words pass'd on bothsides, he gave me the quarter's warning we had stipulated, expressinga wish that he had not been oblig'd to so long a warning. I told himhis wish was unnecessary, for I would leave him that instant; and so,taking my hat, walk'd out of doors, desiring Meredith, whom I sawbelow, to take care of some things I left, and bring them to mylodgings. Meredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my affairover. He had conceiv'd a great regard for me, and was very unwillingthat I should leave the house while he remain'd in it. He dissuaded mefrom returning to my native country, which I began to think of; hereminded me that Keimer was in debt for all he possess'd; that hiscreditors began to be uneasy; that he kept his shop miserably, soldoften without profit for ready money, and often trusted withoutkeeping accounts; that he must therefore fail, which would make avacancy I might profit of. I objected my want of money. He then let meknow that his father had a high opinion of me, and, from somediscourse that had pass'd between them, he was sure would advancemoney to set us up, if I would enter into partnership with him. "Mytime," says he, "will be out with Keimer in the spring; by that timewe may have our press and types in from London. I am sensible I am noworkman; if you like it, your skill in the business shall be setagainst the stock I furnish, and we will share the profits equally." The proposal was agreeable, and I consented; his father was in townand approv'd of it; the more as he saw I had great influence with hisson, had prevailed on him to abstain long from dram-drinking, and hehop'd might break him of that wretched habit entirely, when we came tobe so closely connected. I gave an inventory to the father, whocarry'd it to a merchant; the things were sent for, the secret was tobe kept till they should arrive, and in the meantime I was to getwork, if I could, at the other printing-house. But I found no vacancythere, and so remained idle a few days, when Keimer, on a prospect ofbeing employ'd to print some paper money in New Jersey, which wouldrequire cuts and various types that I only could supply, andapprehending Bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him, sentme a very civil message, that old friends should not part for a fewwords, the effect of sudden passion, and wishing me to return.Meredith persuaded me to comply, as it would give more opportunity forhis improvement under my daily instructions; so I return'd, and wewent on more smoothly than for some time before. The New Jersey jobbwas obtained, I contriv'd a copperplate press for it, the first thathad been seen in the country; I cut several ornaments and checks forthe bills. We went together to Burlington, where I executed the wholeto satisfaction; and he received so large a sum for the work as to beenabled thereby to keep his head much longer above water. At Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal people of theprovince. Several of them had been appointed by the Assembly acommittee to attend the press, and take care that no more bills wereprinted than the law directed. They were therefore, by turns,constantly with us, and generally he who attended, brought with him afriend or two for company. My mind having been much more improv'd byreading than Keimer's, I suppose it was for that reason myconversation seem'd to be more valu'd. They had me to their houses,introduced me to their friends, and show'd me much civility; while he,tho' the master, was a little neglected. In truth, he was an odd fish;ignorant of common life, fond of rudely opposing receiv'd opinions,slovenly to extream dirtiness, enthusiastic in some points ofreligion, and a little knavish withal. We continu'd there near three months; and by that time I could reckonamong my acquired friends, Judge Allen, Samuel Bustill, the secretaryof the Province, Isaac Pearson, Joseph Cooper, and several of theSmiths, members of Assembly, and Isaac Decow, the surveyor-general.The latter was a shrewd, sagacious old man, who told me that he beganfor himself, when young, by wheeling clay for brick-makers, learned towrite after he was of age, carri'd the chain for surveyors, who taughthim surveying, and he had now by his industry, acquir'd a goodestate; and says he, "I foresee that you will soon work this man outof his business, and make a fortune in it at Philadelphia." He had notthen the least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere.These friends were afterwards of great use to me, as I occasionallywas to some of them. They all continued their regard for me as long asthey lived. Before I enter upon my public appearance in business, it may be wellto let you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principlesand morals, that you may see how far those influenc'd the futureevents of my life. My parents had early given me religiousimpressions, and brought me through my childhood piously in theDissenting way. But I was scarce fifteen, when, after doubting byturns of several points, as I found them disputed in the differentbooks I read, I began to doubt of Revelation itself. Some booksagainst Deism fell into my hands; they were said to be thesubstance of sermons preached at Boyle's Lectures. It happened thatthey wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended bythem; for the arguments of the Deists, which were quoted to berefuted, appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short,I soon became a thorough Deist. My arguments perverted some others,particularly Collins and Ralph; but, each of them having afterwardswrong'd me greatly without the least compunction, and recollectingKeith's conduct towards me (who was another free-thinker), and my owntowards Vernon and Miss Read, which at times gave me great trouble, Ibegan to suspect that this doctrine, tho' it might be true, was notvery useful. My London pamphlet, which had for its motto these linesof Dryden: "Whatever is, is right. Though purblind man Sees but a part o' the chain, the nearest link: His eyes not carrying to the equal beam, That poises all above;" and from the attributes of God, his infinite wisdom, goodness andpower, concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world,and that vice and virtue were empty distinctions, no such thingsexisting, appear'd now not so clever a performance as I once thoughtit; and I doubted whether some error had not insinuated itselfunperceiv'd into my argument, so as to infect all that follow'd, as iscommon in metaphysical reasonings. The creed of an eighteenth century theological sect which, while believing in God, refused to credit the possibility of miracles and to acknowledge the validity of revelation. A great English poet, dramatist, and critic (1631-1700). The lines are inaccurately quoted from Dryden's OEdipus, line 293. I grew convinc'd that _truth_, _sincerity_ and _integrity_ in dealingsbetween man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity oflife; and I form'd written resolutions, which still remain in myjournal book, to practice them ever while I lived. Revelation hadindeed no weight with me, as such; but I entertain'd an opinion that,though certain actions might not be bad _because_ they were forbiddenby it, or good _because_ it commanded them, yet probably these actionsmight be forbidden _because_ they were bad for us, or commanded_because_ they were beneficial to us, in their own natures, all thecircumstances of things considered. And this persuasion, with the kindhand of Providence, or some guardian angel, or accidental favourablecircumstances and situations, or all together, preserved me, thro'this dangerous time of youth, and the hazardous situations I wassometimes in among strangers, remote from the eye and advice of myfather, without any willful gross immorality or injustice, that mighthave been expected from my want of religion. I say willful, becausethe instances I have mentioned had something of _necessity_ in them,from my youth, inexperience, and the knavery of others. I hadtherefore a tolerable character to begin the world with; I valued itproperly, and determin'd to preserve it. We had not been long return'd to Philadelphia before the new typesarriv'd from London. We settled with Keimer, and left him by hisconsent before he heard of it. We found a house to hire near themarket, and took it. To lessen the rent, which was then buttwenty-four pounds a year, tho' I have since known it to let forseventy, we took in Thomas Godfrey, a glazier, and his family, whowere to pay a considerable part of it to us, and we to board withthem. We had scarce opened our letters and put our press in order,before George House, an acquaintance of mine, brought a countryman tous, whom he had met in the street inquiring for a printer. All ourcash was now expended in the variety of particulars we had beenobliged to procure, and this countryman's five shillings, being ourfirst-fruits, and coming so seasonably, gave me more pleasure than anycrown I have since earned; and the gratitude I felt toward House hasmade me often more ready than perhaps I should otherwise have been toassist young beginners. There are croakers in every country, always boding its ruin. Such aone then lived in Philadelphia; a person of note, an elderly man, witha wise look and a very grave manner of speaking; his name was SamuelMickle. This gentleman, a stranger to me, stopt one day at my door,and asked me if I was the young man who had lately opened a newprinting-house. Being answered in the affirmative, he said he wassorry for me, because it was an expensive undertaking, and the expensewould be lost; for Philadelphia was a sinking place, the peoplealready half-bankrupts, or near being so; all appearances to thecontrary, such as new buildings and the rise of rents, being to hiscertain knowledge fallacious; for they were, in fact, among the thingsthat would soon ruin us. And he gave me such a detail of misfortunesnow existing, or that were soon to exist, that he left me halfmelancholy. Had I known him before I engaged in this business,probably I never should have done it. This man continued to live inthis decaying place, and to declaim in the same strain, refusing formany years to buy a house there, because all was going todestruction; and at last I had the pleasure of seeing him give fivetimes as much for one as he might have bought it for when he firstbegan his croaking. I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the precedingyear, I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club ofmutual improvement, which was called the Junto; we met on Fridayevenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in histurn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals,Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss'd by the company; andonce in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, onany subject he pleased. Our debates were to be under the direction ofa president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiryafter truth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory; and,to prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, ordirect contradiction, were after some time made contraband, andprohibited under small pecuniary penalties. A Spanish term meaning a combination for political intrigue; here a club or society. The first members were Joseph Breintnal, a copyer of deeds for thescriveners, a good-natur'd, friendly middle-ag'd man, a great loverof poetry, reading all he could meet with, and writing some that wastolerable; very ingenious in many little Nicknackeries, and ofsensible conversation. Thomas Godfrey, a self-taught mathematician, great in his way, andafterward inventor of what is now called Hadley's Quadrant. But heknew little out of his way, and was not a pleasing companion; as, likemost great mathematicians I have met with, he expected universalprecision in everything said, or was forever denying or distinguishingupon trifles, to the disturbance of all conversation. He soon left us. Nicholas Scull, a surveyor, afterwards surveyor-general, who lov'dbooks, and sometimes made a few verses. William Parsons, bred a shoemaker, but, loving reading, had acquir'd aconsiderable share of mathematics, which he first studied with a viewto astrology, that he afterwards laught at it. He also becamesurveyor-general. William Maugridge, a joiner, a most exquisite mechanic, and a solid,sensible man. Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb I have characteriz'dbefore. Robert Grace, a young gentleman of some fortune, generous, lively, andwitty; a lover of punning and of his friends. And William Coleman, then a merchant's clerk, about my age, who hadthe coolest, clearest head, the best heart, and the exactest morals ofalmost any man I ever met with. He became afterwards a merchant ofgreat note, and one of our provincial judges. Our friendship continuedwithout interruption to his death, upwards of forty years; and theclub continued almost as long, and was the best school of philosophy,morality, and politics that then existed in the province; for ourqueries, which were read the week preceding their discussion, put usupon reading with attention upon the several subjects, that we mightspeak more to the purpose; and here, too, we acquired better habits ofconversation, everything being studied in our rules which mightprevent our disgusting each other. From hence the long continuance ofthe club, which I shall have frequent occasion to speak further ofhereafter. But my giving this account of it here is to show something of theinterest I had, everyone of these exerting themselves in recommendingbusiness to us. Breintnal particularly procur'd us from the Quakersthe printing forty sheets of their history, the rest being to be doneby Keimer; and upon this we work'd exceedingly hard, for the price waslow. It was a folio, pro patria size, in pica, with long primernotes. I compos'd of it a sheet a day, and Meredith worked it offat press; it was often eleven at night, and sometimes later, before Ihad finished my distribution for the next day's work, for the littlejobbs sent in by our other friends now and then put us back. But sodetermin'd I was to continue doing a sheet a day of the folio, thatone night, when, having impos'd my forms, I thought my day's workover, one of them by accident was broken, and two pages reduced topi, I immediately distribut'd and composed it over again before Iwent to bed; and this industry, visible to our neighbors, began togive us character and credit; particularly, I was told, that mentionbeing made of the new printing-office at the merchants' Every-nightclub, the general opinion was that it must fail, there being alreadytwo printers in the place, Keimer and Bradford; but Dr. Baird (whomyou and I saw many years after at his native place, St. Andrew's inScotland) gave a contrary opinion: "For the industry of thatFranklin," says he, "is superior to anything I ever saw of the kind; Isee him still at work when I go home from club, and he is at workagain before his neighbors are out of bed." This struck the rest, andwe soon after had offers from one of them to supply us withstationery; but as yet we did not chuse to engage in shop business. A sheet 8-1/2 by 13-1/2 inches, having the words _pro patria_ in translucent letters in the body of the paper. Pica--a size of type; as, A B C D: Long Primer--a smaller size of type; as, A B C D. To arrange and lock up pages or columns of type in a rectangular iron frame, ready for printing. Reduced to complete disorder. I mention this industry the more particularly and the more freely,tho' it seems to be talking in my own praise, that those of myposterity, who shall read it, may know the use of that virtue, whenthey see its effects in my favour throughout this relation. George Webb, who had found a female friend that lent him wherewith topurchase his time of Keimer, now came to offer himself as ajourneyman to us. We could not then employ him; but I foolishly lethim know as a secret that I soon intended to begin a newspaper, andmight then have work for him. My hopes of success, as I told him, werefounded on this, that the then only newspaper, printed by Bradford,was a paltry thing, wretchedly manag'd, no way entertaining, and yetwas profitable to him; I therefore thought a good paper would scarcelyfail of good encouragement. I requested Webb not to mention it; but hetold it to Keimer, who immediately, to be beforehand with me,published proposals for printing one himself, on which Webb was to beemploy'd. I resented this; and, to counteras I could not yetbegin our paper, I wrote several pieces of entertainment forBradford's paper, under the title of the Busy Body, which Breintnalcontinu'd some months. By this means the attention of the publick wasfixed on that paper, and Keimer's proposals, which we burlesqu'd andridicul'd, were disregarded. He began his paper, however, and, aftercarrying it on three quarters of a year, with at most only ninetysubscribers, he offered it to me for a trifle; and I, having beenready some time to go on with it, took it in hand directly; and itprov'd in a few years extremely profitable to me. I perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular number, though ourpartnership still continu'd; the reason may be that, in fact, thewhole management of the business lay upon me. Meredith was nocompositor, a poor pressman, and seldom sober. My friends lamented myconnection with him, but I was to make the best of it. Our first papers made a quite different appearance from any before inthe province; a better type, and better printed; but some spiritedremarks of my writing, on the dispute then going on between GovernorBurnet and the Massachusetts Assembly, struck the principal people,occasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talk'd of, andin a few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers. Their example was follow'd by many, and our number went on growingcontinually. This was one of the first good effects of my havinglearnt a little to scribble; another was, that the leading men, seeinga newspaper now in the hands of one who could also handle a pen,thought it convenient to oblige and encourage me. Bradford stillprinted the votes, and laws, and other publick business. He hadprinted an address of the House to the governor, in a coarse,blundering manner; we reprinted it elegantly and correctly, and sentone to every member. They were sensible of the difference: itstrengthened the hands of our friends in the House, and they voted ustheir printers for the year ensuing. Among my friends in the House I must not forget Mr. Hamilton, beforementioned, who was then returned from England, and had a seat in it.He interested himself for me strongly in that instance, as he did inmany others afterward, continuing his patronage till his death. I got his son once £500.--_Marg. note_. Mr. Vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt I ow'd him,but did not press me. I wrote him an ingenuous letter ofacknowledgment, crav'd his forbearance a little longer, which heallow'd me, and as soon as I was able, I paid the principal withinterest, and many thanks; so that erratum was in some degreecorrected. But now another difficulty came upon me which I had never the leastreason to expect. Mr. Meredith's father, who was to have paid for ourprinting-house, according to the expectations given me, was able toadvance only one hundred pounds currency, which had been paid; and ahundred more was due to the merchant, who grew impatient, and su'd usall. We gave bail, but saw that, if the money could not be rais'd intime, the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution, and ourhopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined, as the press and lettersmust be sold for payment, perhaps at half price. In this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have neverforgotten, nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing, cameto me separately, unknown to each other, and, without any applicationfrom me, offering each of them to advance me all the money that shouldbe necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself, ifthat should be practicable; but they did not like my continuing thepartnership with Meredith, who, as they said, was often seen drunk inthe streets, and playing at low games in alehouses, much to ourdiscredit. These two friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace. Itold them I could not propose a separation while any prospect remain'dof the Meredith's fulfilling their part of our agreement, because Ithought myself under great obligations to them for what they had done,and would do if they could; but, if they finally fail'd in theirperformance, and our partnership must be dissolv'd, I should thenthink myself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends. Thus the matter rested for some time, when I said to my partner,"Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertakenin this affair of ours, and is unwilling to advance for you and mewhat he would for you alone. If that is the case, tell me, and I willresign the whole to you, and go about my business." "No," said he, "myfather has really been disappointed, and is really unable; and I amunwilling to distress him farther. I see this is a business I am notfit for. I was bred a farmer, and it was a folly in me to come totown, and put myself, at thirty years of age, an apprentice to learn anew trade. Many of our Welsh people are going to settle in NorthCarolina, where land is cheap. I am inclin'd to go with them, andfollow my old employment. You may find friends to assist you. If youwill take the debts of the company upon you; return to my father thehundred pounds he has advanced; pay my little personal debts, and giveme thirty pounds and a new saddle, I will relinquish the partnership,and leave the whole in your hands." I agreed to this proposal: it wasdrawn up in writing, sign'd, and seal'd immediately. I gave him whathe demanded, and he went soon after to Carolina, from whence he sentme next year two long letters, containing the best account that hadbeen given of that country, the climate, the soil, husbandry, etc.,for in those matters he was very judicious. I printed them in thepapers, and they gave great satisfaction to the publick. As soon as he was gone, I recurr'd to my two friends; and because Iwould not give an unkind preference to either, I took half of whateach had offered and I wanted of one, and half of the other; paid offthe company's debts, and went on with the business in my own name,advertising that the partnership was dissolved. I think this was in orabout the year 1729. VIII BUSINESS SUCCESS AND FIRSTPUBLIC SERVICE About this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money,only fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the province, and thatsoon to be sunk. The wealthy inhabitants oppos'd any addition,being against all paper currency, from an apprehension that it woulddepreciate, as it had done in New England, to the prejudice of allcreditors. We had discuss'd this point in our Junto, where I was onthe side of an addition, being persuaded that the first small sumstruck in 1723 had done much good by increasing the trade, employment,and number of inhabitants in the province, since I now saw all the oldhouses inhabited, and many new ones building: whereas I rememberedwell, that when I first walk'd about the streets of Philadelphia,eating my roll, I saw most of the houses in Walnut Street, betweenSecond and Front streets, with bills on their doors, "To be let";and many likewise in Chestnut-street and other streets, which made methen think the inhabitants of the city were deserting it one afteranother. Recalled to be redeemed. This part of Philadelphia is now the center of the wholesale business district. Our debates possess'd me so fully of the subject, that I wrote andprinted an anonymous pamphlet on it, entitled "_The Nature andNecessity of a Paper Currency_." It was well receiv'd by the commonpeople in general; but the rich men dislik'd it, for it increas'd andstrengthen'd the clamor for more money, and they happening to have nowriters among them that were able to answer it, their oppositionslacken'd, and the point was carried by a majority in the House. Myfriends there, who conceiv'd I had been of some service, thought fitto reward me by employing me in printing the money; a very profitablejobb and a great help to me. This was another advantage gain'd by mybeing able to write. The utility of this currency became by time and experience so evidentas never afterwards to be much disputed; so that it grew soon tofifty-five thousand pounds, and in 1739 to eighty thousand pounds,since which it arose during war to upwards of three hundred and fiftythousand pounds, trade, building, and inhabitants all the whileincreasing, tho' I now think there are limits beyond which thequantity may be hurtful. Paper money is a promise to pay its face value in gold or silver. When a state or nation issues more such promises than there is a likelihood of its being able to redeem, the paper representing the promises depreciates in value. Before the success of the Colonies in the Revolution was assured, it took hundreds of dollars of their paper money to buy a pair of boots. I soon after obtain'd, thro' my friend Hamilton, the printing of theNewcastle paper money, another profitable jobb as I then thought it;small things appearing great to those in small circumstances; andthese, to me, were really great advantages, as they were greatencouragements. He procured for me, also, the printing of the laws andvotes of that government, which continu'd in my hands as long as Ifollow'd the business. I now open'd a little stationer's shop. I had in it blanks of allsorts, the correctest that ever appear'd among us, being assisted inthat by my friend Breintnal. I had also paper, parchment, chapmen'sbooks, etc. One Whitemash, a compositor I had known in London, anexcellent workman, now came to me, and work'd with me constantly anddiligently; and I took an apprentice, the son of Aquilla Rose. I began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for theprinting-house. In order to secure my credit and character as atradesman, I took care not only to be in _reality_ industrious andfrugal, but to avoid all appearances to the contrary. I drest plainly;I was seen at no places of idle diversion. I never went out a fishingor shooting; a book, indeed, sometimes debauch'd me from my work, butthat was seldom, snug, and gave no scandal; and, to show that I wasnot above my business, I sometimes brought home the paper I purchas'dat the stores thro' the streets on a wheelbarrow. Thus being esteem'dan industrious, thriving young man, and paying duly for what I bought,the merchants who imported stationery solicited my custom; othersproposed supplying me with books, and I went on swimmingly. In themeantime, Keimer's credit and business declining daily, he was at lastforc'd to sell his printing-house to satisfy his creditors. He went toBarbadoes, and there lived some years in very poor circumstances. His apprentice, David Harry, whom I had instructed while I work'd withhim, set up in his place at Philadelphia, having bought his materials.I was at first apprehensive of a powerful rival in Harry, as hisfriends were very able, and had a good deal of interest. I thereforepropos'd a partnership to him, which he, fortunately for me, rejectedwith scorn. He was very proud, dress'd like a gentleman, liv'dexpensively, took much diversion and pleasure abroad, ran in debt, andneglected his business; upon which, all business left him; and,finding nothing to do, he followed Keimer to Barbadoes, taking theprinting-house with him. There this apprentice employ'd his formermaster as a journeyman; they quarrell'd often; Harry went continuallybehindhand, and at length was forc'd to sell his types and return tohis country work in Pennsylvania. The person that bought them employ'dKeimer to use them, but in a few years he died. There remained now no competitor with me at Philadelphia but the oldone, Bradford; who was rich and easy, did a little printing now andthen by straggling hands, but was not very anxious about the business.However, as he kept the post-office, it was imagined he had betteropportunities of obtaining news; his paper was thought a betterdistributer of advertisements than mine, and therefore had many more,which was a profitable thing to him, and a disadvantage to me; for,tho' I did indeed receive and send papers by the post, yet the publickopinion was otherwise, for what I did send was by bribing the riders,who took them privately, Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it,which occasion'd some resentment on my part; and I thought so meanlyof him for it, that, when I afterward came into his situation, I tookcare never to imitate it. I had hitherto continu'd to board with Godfrey, who lived in part ofmy house with his wife and children, and had one side of the shop forhis glazier's business, tho' he worked little, being always absorbedin his mathematics. Mrs. Godfrey projected a match for me with arelation's daughter, took opportunities of bringing us often together,till a serious courtship on my part ensu'd, the girl being in herselfvery deserving. The old folks encourag'd me by continual invitationsto supper, and by leaving us together, till at length it was time toexplain. Mrs. Godfrey manag'd our little treaty. I let her know that Iexpected as much money with their daughter as would pay off myremaining debt for the printing-house, which I believe was not thenabove a hundred pounds. She brought me word they had no such sum tospare; I said they might mortgage their house in the loan-office. Theanswer to this, after some days, was, that they did not approve thematch; that, on inquiry of Bradford, they had been informed theprinting business was not a profitable one; the types would soon beworn out, and more wanted; that S. Keimer and D. Harry had failed oneafter the other, and I should probably soon follow them; and,therefore, I was forbidden the house, and the daughter shut up. Whether this was a real change of sentiment or only artifice, on asupposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract, andtherefore that we should steal a marriage, which would leave them atliberty to give or withhold what they pleas'd, I know not; but Isuspected the latter, resented it, and went no more. Mrs. Godfreybrought me afterward some more favorable accounts of theirdisposition, and would have drawn me on again; but I declaredabsolutely my resolution to have nothing more to do with that family.This was resented by the Godfreys; we differed, and they removed,leaving me the whole house, and I resolved to take no more inmates. But this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I look'd roundme and made overtures of acquaintance in other places; but soon foundthat, the business of a printer being generally thought a poor one, Iwas not to expect money with a wife, unless with such a one as Ishould not otherwise think agreeable. A friendly correspondence asneighbours and old acquaintances had continued between me and Mrs.Read's family, who all had a regard for me from the time of my firstlodging in their house. I was often invited there and consulted intheir affairs, wherein I sometimes was of service. I piti'd poor MissRead's unfortunate situation, who was generally dejected, seldomchearful, and avoided company. I considered my giddiness andinconstancy when in London as in a great degree the cause of herunhappiness, tho' the mother was good enough to think the fault moreher own than mine, as she had prevented our marrying before I wentthither, and persuaded the other match in my absence. Our mutualaffection was revived, but there were now great objections to ourunion. The match was indeed looked upon as invalid, a preceding wifebeing said to be living in England; but this could not easily beprov'd, because of the distance; and, tho' there was a report of hisdeath, it was not certain. Then, tho' it should be true, he had leftmany debts, which his successor might be call'd upon to pay. Weventured, however, over all these difficulties, and I took her towife, September 1st, 1730. None of the inconveniences happened that wehad apprehended; she proved a good and faithful helpmate, assistedme much by attending the shop; we throve together, and have evermutually endeavour'd to make each other happy. Thus I corrected thatgreat _erratum_ as well as I could. Mrs. Franklin survived her marriage over forty years. Franklin's correspondence abounds with evidence that their union was a happy one. "We are grown old together, and if she has any faults, I am so used to them that I don't perceive them." The following is a stanza from one of Franklin's own songs written for the Junto: "Of their Chloes and Phyllises poets may prate, I sing my plain country Joan, These twelve years my wife, still the joy of my life, Blest day that I made her my own." About this time, our club meeting, not at a tavern, but in a littleroom of Mr. Grace's, set apart for that purpose, a proposition wasmade by me, that, since our books were often referr'd to in ourdisquisitions upon the queries, it might be convenient to us to havethem altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might beconsulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, weshould, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us theadvantage of using the books of all the other members, which would benearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole. It was lik'd andagreed to, and we fill'd one end of the room with such books as wecould best spare. The number was not so great as we expected; and tho'they had been of great use, yet some inconveniences occurring for wantof due care of them, the collection, after about a year, wasseparated, and each took his books home again. And now I set on foot my first project of a public nature, that for asubscription library. I drew up the proposals, got them put into formby our great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help of my friends inthe Junto, procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each to beginwith, and ten shillings a year for fifty years, the term our companywas to continue. We afterwards obtain'd a charter, the company beingincreased to one hundred: this was the mother of all the NorthAmerican subscription libraries, now so numerous. It is become a greatthing itself, and continually increasing. These libraries haveimproved the general conversation of the Americans, made the commontradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from othercountries, and perhaps have contributed in some degree to the stand sogenerally made throughout the colonies in defense of theirprivileges. _Mem°._ Thus far was written with the intention express'd in thebeginning and therefore contains several little family anecdotes of noimportance to others. What follows was written many years after incompliance with the advice contain'd in these letters, and accordinglyintended for the public. The affairs of the Revolution occasion'd theinterruption. Here the first part of the _Autobiography_, written at Twyford in 1771, ends. The second part, which follows, was written at Passy in 1784. After this memorandum, Franklin inserted letters from Abel James and Benjamin Vaughan, urging him to continue his _Autobiography_. It is some time since I receiv'd the above letters, but I have beentoo busy till now to think of complying with the request they contain.It might, too, be much better done if I were at home among my papers,which would aid my memory, and help to ascertain dates; but my returnbeing uncertain, and having just now a little leisure, I willendeavour to recollect and write what I can; if I live to get home, itmay there be corrected and improv'd. Not having any copy here of what is already written, I know notwhether an account is given of the means I used to establish thePhiladelphia public library, which, from a small beginning, is nowbecome so considerable, though I remember to have come down to nearthe time of that transaction (1730). I will therefore begin here withan account of it, which may be struck out if found to have beenalready given. At the time I establish'd myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a goodbookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston.In New York and Philad'a the printers were indeed stationers; theysold only paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few commonschool-books. Those who lov'd reading were obliged to send for theirbooks from England; the members of the Junto had each a few. We hadleft the alehouse, where we first met, and hired a room to hold ourclub in. I propos'd that we should all of us bring our books to thatroom, where they would not only be ready to consult in ourconferences, but become a common benefit, each of us being at libertyto borrow such as he wish'd to read at home. This was accordinglydone, and for some time contented us. Finding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd to renderthe benefit from books more common, by commencing a publicsubscription library. I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that wouldbe necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden, toput the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed, bywhich each subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the firstpurchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them. Sofew were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majority ofus so poor, that I was not able, with great industry, to find morethan fifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay down forthis purpose forty shillings each, and ten shillings per annum. Onthis little fund we began. The books were imported; the library wasopened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers, on theirpromissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned. Theinstitution soon manifested its utility, was imitated by other towns,and in other provinces. The libraries were augmented by donations;reading became fashionable; and our people, having no publickamusements to divert their attention from study, became betteracquainted with books, and in a few years were observ'd by strangersto be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the samerank generally are in other countries. When we were about to sign the above mentioned articles, which wereto be binding on us, our heirs, etc., for fifty years, Mr. Brockden,the scrivener, said to us, "You are young men, but it is scarcelyprobable that any of you will live to see the expiration of the termfix'd in the instrument." A number of us, however, are yet living; butthe instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter thatincorporated and gave perpetuity to the company. The objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting thesubscriptions, made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one'sself as the proposer of any useful project, that might be suppos'd toraise one's reputation in the smallest degree above that of one'sneighbours, when one has need of their assistance to accomplish thatproject. I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, andstated it as a scheme of a _number of friends_, who had requested meto go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading.In this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever afterpractis'd it on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes, canheartily recommend it. The present little sacrifice of your vanitywill afterwards be amply repaid. If it remains a while uncertain towhom the merit belongs, someone more vain than yourself will beencouraged to claim it, and then even envy will be disposed to do youjustice by plucking those assumed feathers, and restoring them totheir right owner. This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study,for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair'd insome degree the loss of the learned education my father once intendedfor me. Reading was the only amusement I allow'd myself. I spent notime in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind; and my industry inmy business continu'd as indefatigable as it was necessary. I wasindebted for my printing-house; I had a young family coming on to beeducated, and I had to contend with for business two printers, whowere established in the place before me. My circumstances, however,grew daily easier. My original habits of frugality continuing, and myfather having, among his instructions to me when a boy, frequentlyrepeated a proverb of Solomon, "Seest thou a man diligent in hiscalling, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before meanmen," I from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealthand distinction, which encourag'd me, tho' I did not think that Ishould ever literally _stand before kings_, which, however, has sincehappened; for I have stood before _five_, and even had the honor ofsitting down with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner. We have an English proverb that says, "_He that would thrive, must askhis wife_." It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos'd toindustry and frugality as myself. She assisted me chearfully in mybusiness, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasingold linen rags for the paper-makers, etc., etc. We kept no idleservants, our table was plain and simple, our furniture of thecheapest. For instance, my breakfast was a long time break and milk(no tea), and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer, with apewter spoon. But mark how luxury will enter families, and make aprogress, in spite of principle: being call'd one morning tobreakfast, I found it in a China bowl, with a spoon of silver! Theyhad been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife, and had costher the enormous sum of three-and-twenty shillings, for which she hadno other excuse or apology to make, but that she thought _her_ husbanddeserv'd a silver spoon and China bowl as well as any of hisneighbors. This was the first appearance of plate and China in ourhouse, which afterward, in a course of years, as our wealth increas'd,augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value. I had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and though some ofthe dogmas of that persuasion, such as the _eternal decrees of God_,_election_, _reprobation_, _etc._, appeared to me unintelligible,others doubtful, and I early absented myself from the publicassemblies of the sect, Sunday being my studying day, I never waswithout some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, theexistence of the Deity; that he made the world, and govern'd it by hisProvidence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing goodto man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will bepunished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter. These Iesteem'd the essentials of every religion; and, being to be found inall the religions we had in our country, I respected them all, tho'with different degrees of respect, as I found them more or less mix'dwith other articles, which, without any tendency to inspire, promote,or confirm morality, serv'd principally to divide us, and make usunfriendly to one another. This respect to all, with an opinion thatthe worst had some good effects, induc'd me to avoid all discoursethat might tend to lessen the good opinion another might have of hisown religion; and as our province increas'd in people, and new placesof worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntarycontribution, my mite for such purpose, whatever might be the sect,was never refused. Tho' I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an opinion ofits propriety, and of its utility when rightly conducted, and Iregularly paid my annual subscription for the support of the onlyPresbyterian minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia. He us'd tovisit me sometimes as a friend, and admonished me to attend hisadministrations, and I was now and then prevail'd on to do so, oncefor five Sundays successively. Had he been in my opinion a goodpreacher, perhaps I might have continued, notwithstanding theoccasion I had for the Sunday's leisure in my course of study; but hisdiscourses were chiefly either polemic arguments, or explications ofthe peculiar doctrines of our sect, and were all to me very dry,uninteresting, and unedifying, since not a single moral principle wasinculcated or enforc'd, their aim seeming to be rather to make usPresbyterians than good citizens. Franklin expressed a different view about the duty of attending church later. At length he took for his text that verse of the fourth "_Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest,just, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue, or anypraise, think on these things._" And I imagin'd, in a sermon on such atext, we could not miss of having some morality. But he confin'dhimself to five points only, as meant by the apostle, viz.: 1. Keepingholy the Sabbath day. 2. Being diligent in reading the holyScriptures. 3. Attending duly the publick worship. 4. Partaking of theSacrament. 5. Paying a due respect to God's ministers. These might beall good things; but, as they were not the kind of good things that Iexpected from that text, I despaired of ever meeting with them fromany other, was disgusted, and attended his preaching no more. I hadsome years before compos'd a little Liturgy, or form of prayer, for myown private use (viz., in 1728), entitled, _Articles of Belief andActs of Religion_. I return'd to the use of this, and went no more tothe public assemblies. My conduct might be blameable, but I leave it,without attempting further to excuse it; my present purpose being torelate facts, and not to make apologies for them. IX PLAN FOR ATTAINING MORALPERFECTION It was about this time I conceived the bold and arduous project ofarriving at moral perfection. I wish'd to live without committing anyfault at any time; I would conquer all that either naturalinclination, custom, or company might lead me into. As I knew, orthought I knew, what was right and wrong, I did not see why I mightnot always do the one and avoid the other. But I soon found I hadundertaken a task of more difficulty than I had imagined. While mycare was employ'd in guarding against one fault, I was often surprisedby another; habit took the advantage of inattention; inclination wassometimes too strong for reason. I concluded, at length, that the merespeculative conviction that it was our interest to be completelyvirtuous, was not sufficient to prevent our slipping; and that thecontrary habits must be broken, and good ones acquired andestablished, before we can have any dependence on a steady, uniformrectitude of conduct. For this purpose I therefore contrived thefollowing method. Compare Philippians iv, 8. In the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had met with in myreading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous, as differentwriters included more or fewer ideas under the same name. Temperance,for example, was by some confined to eating and drinking, while byothers it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure,appetite, inclination, or passion, bodily or mental, even to ouravarice and ambition. I propos'd to myself, for the sake of clearness,to use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex'd to each, than a fewnames with more ideas; and I included under thirteen names of virtuesall that at that time occurr'd to me as necessary or desirable, andannexed to each a short precept, which fully express'd the extent Igave to its meaning. These names of virtues, with their precepts, were: 1. Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation. 2. Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid triflingconversation. 3. Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your businesshave its time. 4. Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what youresolve. 5. Frugality. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; _i. e._, wastenothing. 6. INDUSTRY. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off allunnecessary actions. 7. Sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly; and, if you speak,speak accordingly. 8. Justice. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are yourduty. 9. Moderation. Avoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think theydeserve. 10. Cleanliness. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation. 11. Tranquillity. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable. 12. Chastity. 13. Humility. Imitate Jesus and Socrates. My intention being to acquire the _habitude_ of all these virtues, Ijudg'd it would be well not to distrattention by attempting thewhole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when Ishould be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, tillI should have gone thro' the thirteen; and, as the previousacquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certainothers, I arrang'd them with that view, as they stand above.Temperance first, as it tends to procure that coolness and clearnessof head, which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be keptup, and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancienthabits, and the force of perpetual temptations. This being acquir'dand establish'd, Silence would be more easy; and my desire being togain knowledge at the same time that I improv'd in virtue, andconsidering that in conversation it was obtain'd rather by the use ofthe ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit Iwas getting into of prattling, punning, and joking, which only made meacceptable to trifling company, I gave _Silence_ the second place.This and the next, _Order_, I expected would allow me more time forattending to my project and my studies. _Resolution_, once becomehabitual, would keep me firm in my endeavours to obtain all thesubsequent virtues; _Frugality_ and Industry freeing me from myremaining debt, and producing affluence and independence, would makemore easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice, etc., etc. Conceivingthen, that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras in his GoldenVerses, daily examination would be necessary, I contrived thefollowing method for conducting that examination. I made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of thevirtues. I rul'd each page with red ink, so as to have sevencolumns, one for each day of the week, marking each column with aletter for the day. I cross'd these columns with thirteen red lines,marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of thevirtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by alittle black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have beencommitted respecting that virtue upon that day. A famous Greek philosopher, who lived about 582-500 B. C. The _Golden Verses_ here ascribed to him are probably of later origin. "The time which he recommends for this work is about even or bed-time, that we may conclude the action of the day with the judgment of conscience, making the examination of our conversation an evening song to God." This "little book" is dated July 1, 1733.--W. T. F. _Form of the pages._ TEMPERANCE.

Thus, in the first week, my great guard was to avoidevery the least offense against _Temperance_, leaving the othervirtues to their ordinary chance, only marking every evening thefaults of the day. Thus, if in the first week I could keep my firstline, marked T, clear of spots, I suppos'd the habit of that virtue somuch strengthen'd, and its opposite weaken'd, that I might ventureextending my attention to include the next, and for the following weekkeep both lines clear of spots. Proceeding thus to the last, I couldgo thro' a course compleat in thirteen weeks, and four courses in ayear. And like him who, having a garden to weed, does not attempt toeradicate all the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach andhis strength, but works on one of the beds at a time, and, havingaccomplish'd the first, proceeds to a second, so I should have, Ihoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress Imade in virtue, by clearing successively my lines of their spots, tillin the end, by a number of courses, I should be happy in viewing aclean book, after a thirteen weeks' daily examination. This my little book had for its motto these lines from Addison's_Cato_: "Here will I hold. If there's a power above us (And that there is, all nature cries aloud Thro' all her works), He must delight in virtue; And that which he delights in must be happy." Another from Cicero, "O vitæ Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix expultrixquevitiorum! Unus dies, bene et ex præceptis tuisactus, peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus." "O philosophy, guide of life! O searcher out of virtue and exterminator of vice! One day spent well and in accordance with thy precepts is worth an immortality of sin."--_Tusculan Inquiries_, Book V. Another from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of wisdom or virtue: "Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left handriches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness,and all her paths are peace." iii. 16, 17. And conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I thought it rightand necessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it; to this endI formed the following little prayer, which was prefix'd to my tablesof examination, for daily use. "_O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! mercifulGuide! Increase in me that wisdom which discovers mytruest interest. Strengthen my resolutions to perform whatthat wisdom dictates. Accept my kind offices to thy otherchildren as the only return in my power for thy continualfavours to me_." I used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomson'sPoems, viz.: "Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme! O teach me what is good; teach me Thyself! Save me from folly, vanity, and vice, From every low pursuit; and fill my soul With knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure; Sacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!" The precept of _Order_ requiring that _every part of my businessshould have its allotted time_, one page in my little book contain'dthe following scheme of employment for the twenty-four hours of anatural day. { 5} Rise, wash, and address { 6} _Powerful Goodness_!The Morning. { } Contrive day's_Question._ What good { } business, and take theshall I do this day? { } resolution of the day; { 7} prosecute the present { } study, and breakfast. 8} 9} Work. 10} 11} Noon. Read, or overlook my { 1} accounts, and dine. 2} 3} Work. 4} 5}Evening. { 6} Put things in their_Question._ What good { 7} places. Supper. Musichave I done to-day? { 8} or diversion, or conversation. { 9} Examination of { } the day. Night. Sleep. { 1} { 2} { 3} { 4} I enter'd upon the execution of this plan for self-examination, andcontinu'd it with occasional intermissions for some time. I wassurpris'd to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined;but I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish. To avoid thetrouble of renewing now and then my little book, which, by scrapingout the marks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones ina new course, became full of holes, I transferr'd my tables andprecepts to the ivory leaves of a memorandum book, on which the lineswere drawn with red ink, that made a durable stain, and on those linesI mark'd my faults with a black-lead pencil, which marks I couldeasily wipe out with a wet sponge. After a while I went thro' onecourse only in a year, and afterward only one in several years, tillat length I omitted them entirely, being employ'd in voyages andbusiness abroad, with a multiplicity of affairs that interfered; but Ialways carried my little book with me. My scheme of Order gave me the most trouble; and I found that, tho'it might be practicable where a man's business was such as to leavehim the disposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer, forinstance, it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master, whomust mix with the world, and often receive people of business at theirown hours. _Order_, too, with regard to places for things, papers,etc., I found extreamly difficult to acquire. I had not been earlyaccustomed to it, and, having an exceeding good memory, I was not sosensible of the inconvenience attending want of method. This article,therefore, cost me so much painful attention, and my faults in itvexed me so much, and I made so little progress in amendment, and hadsuch frequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give up theattempt, and content myself with a faulty character in that respect,like the man who, in buying an ax of a smith, my neighbour, desired tohave the whole of its surface as bright as the edge. The smithconsented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel; heturn'd, while the smith press'd the broad face of the ax hard andheavily on the stone, which made the turning of it very fatiguing. Theman came every now and then from the wheel to see how the work wenton, and at length would take his ax as it was, without farthergrinding. "No," said the smith, "turn on, turn on; we shall have itbright by-and-by; as yet, it is only speckled." "Yes," says the man,"_but I think I like a speckled ax best_." And I believe this may havebeen the case with many, who, having, for want of some such means as Iemploy'd, found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking badhabits in other points of vice and virtue, have given up the struggle,and concluded that "_a speckled ax was best_"; for something, thatpretended to be reason, was every now and then suggesting to me thatsuch extream nicety as I exacted of myself might be a kind of fopperyin morals, which, if it were known, would make me ridiculous; that aperfect character might be attended with the inconvenience of beingenvied and hated; and that a benevolent man should allow a few faultsin himself, to keep his friends in countenance. Professor McMaster tells us that when Franklin was American Agent in France, his lack of business order was a source of annoyance to his colleagues and friends. "Strangers who came to see him were amazed to behold papers of the greatest importance scattered in the most careless way over the table and floor." In truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order; and now Iam grown old, and my memory bad, I feel very sensibly the want of it.But, on the whole, tho' I never arrived at the perfection I had beenso ambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by theendeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should havebeen if I had not attempted it; as those who aim at perfect writing byimitating the engraved copies, tho' they never reach the wish'd-forexcellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavour, andis tolerable while it continues fair and legible. It may be well my posterity should be informed that to this littleartifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor ow'd the constantfelicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which this is written.What reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of Providence;but, if they arrive, the reflection on past happiness enjoy'd ought tohelp his bearing them with more resignation. To Temperance he ascribeshis long-continued health, and what is still left to him of a goodconstitution; to Industry and Frugality, the early easiness of hiscircumstances and acquisition of his fortune, with all that knowledgethat enabled him to be a useful citizen, and obtained for him somedegree of reputation among the learned; to Sincerity and Justice, theconfidence of his country, and the honorable employs it conferred uponhim; and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues,even in the imperfect state he was able to acquire them, all thatevenness of temper, and that cheerfulness in conversation, which makeshis company still sought for, and agreeable even to his youngeracquaintance. I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants mayfollow the example and reap the benefit. While there can be no question that Franklin's moral improvement and happiness were due to the practice of these virtues, yet most people will agree that we shall have to go back of his plan for the impelling motive to a virtuous life. Franklin's own suggestion that the scheme smacks of "foppery in morals" seems justified. Woodrow Wilson well puts it: "Men do not take fire from such thoughts, unless something deeper, which is missing here, shine through them. What may have seemed to the eighteenth century a system of morals seems to us nothing more vital than a collection of the precepts of good sense and sound conduct. What redeems it from pettiness in this book is the scope of power and of usefulness to be seen in Franklin himself, who set these standards up in all seriousness and candor for his own life." See _Galatians_, for the Christian plan of moral perfection. It will be remark'd that, tho' my scheme was not wholly withoutreligion, there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenetsof any particular sect. I had purposely avoided them; for, being fullypersuaded of the utility and excellency of my method, and that itmight be serviceable to people in all religions, and intending sometime or other to publish it, I would not have anything in it thatshould prejudice anyone, of any sect, against it. I purposed writing alittle comment on each virtue, in which I would have shown theadvantages of possessing it, and the mischiefs attending its oppositevice; and I should have called my book The Art of Virtue, becauseit would have shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue, whichwould have distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good, thatdoes not instruct and indicate the means, but is like the apostle'sman of verbal charity, who only without showing to the naked andhungry how or where they might get clothes or victuals, exhorted themto be fed and clothed.--James ii. 15, 16. Nothing so likely to make a man's fortune as virtue.--_Marg. note_. But it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing thiscomment was never fulfilled. I did, indeed, from time to time, putdown short hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to be made useof in it, some of which I have still by me; but the necessary closeattention to private business in the earlier part of my life, andpublic business since, have occasioned my postponing it; for, it beingconnected in my mind with _a great and extensive project_, thatrequired the whole man to execute, and which an unforeseen successionof employs prevented my attending to, it has hitherto remain'dunfinish'd. In this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine,that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden, butforbidden because they are hurtful, the nature of man aloneconsidered; that it was, therefore, everyone's interest to be virtuouswho wish'd to be happy even in this world; and I should, from thiscircumstance (there being always in the world a number of richmerchants, nobility, states, and princes, who have need of honestinstruments for the management of their affairs, and such being sorare), have endeavoured to convince young persons that no qualitieswere so likely to make a poor man's fortune as those of probity andintegrity. My list of virtues contain'd at first but twelve; but a Quaker friendhaving kindly informed me that I was generally thought proud; that mypride show'd itself frequently in conversation; that I was not contentwith being in the right when discussing any point, but wasoverbearing, and rather insolent, of which he convinc'd me bymentioning several instances; I determined endeavouring to curemyself, if I could, of this vice or folly among the rest, and I added_Humility_ to my list, giving an extensive meaning to the word. I cannot boast of much success in acquiring the _reality_ of thisvirtue, but I had a good deal with regard to the _appearance_ of it. Imade it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentimentsof others, and all positive assertion of my own. I even forbid myself,agreeably to the old laws of our Junto, the use of every word orexpression in the language that imported a fix'd opinion, such as_certainly, undoubtedly_, etc., and I adopted, instead of them, _Iconceive, I apprehend_, or _I imagine_ a thing to be so or so; or it_so appears to me at present_. When another asserted something that Ithought an error, I deny'd myself the pleasure of contradicting himabruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity in hisproposition; and in answering I began by observing that in certaincases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the presentcase there _appear'd_ or _seem'd_ to me some difference, etc. I soonfound the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations Iengag'd in went on more pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos'dmy opinions procur'd them a readier reception and less contradiction;I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and Imore easily prevail'd with others to give up their mistakes and joinwith me when I happened to be in the right. And this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to naturalinclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual to me, thatperhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmaticalexpression escape me. And to this habit (after my character ofintegrity) I think it principally owing that I had early so muchweight with my fellow-citizens when I proposed new institutions, oralterations in the old, and so much influence in public councils whenI became a member; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent,subject to much hesitation in my choice of words, hardly correct inlanguage, and yet I generally carried my points. In reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hardto subdue as _pride_. Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down,stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, andwill every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it,perhaps, often in this history; for, even if I could conceive that Ihad compleatly overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility. This is a marginal memorandum.--B. Having mentioned _a great and extensive project_ which I hadconceiv'd, it seems proper that some account should be here given ofthat project and its object. Its first rise in my mind appears in thefollowing little paper, accidentally preserv'd, viz.: _Observations_ on my reading history, in Library, May 19th, 1731. "That the great affairs of the world, the wars, revolutions, etc., arecarried on and effected by parties. "That the view of these parties is their present general interest, orwhat they take to be such. "That the different views of these different parties occasion allconfusion. "That while a party is carrying on a general design, each man has hisparticular private interest in view. "That as soon as a party has gain'd its general point, each memberbecomes intent upon his particular interest; which, thwarting others,breaks that party into divisions, and occasions more confusion. "That few in public affairs a mere view of the good of theircountry, whatever they may pretend; and, tho' their actings bring realgood to their country, yet men primarily considered that their own andtheir country's interest was united, and did not a principleof benevolence. "That fewer still, in public affairs, a view to the good ofmankind. "There seems to me at present to be great occasion for raising aUnited Party for Virtue, by forming the virtuous and good men of allnations into a regular body, to be govern'd by suitable good and wiserules, which good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in theirobedience to, than common people are to common laws. "I at present think that whoever attempts this aright, and is wellqualified, cannot fail of pleasing God, and of meeting with success. B. F." Revolving this project in my mind, as to be undertaken hereafter, whenmy circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure, I put downfrom time to time, on pieces of paper, such thoughts as occurr'd to merespecting it. Most of these are lost; but I find one purporting to bethe substance of an intended creed, containing, as I thought, theessentials of every known religion, and being free of everything thatmight shock the professors of any religion. It is express'd in thesewords, viz.: "That there is one God, who made all things. "That he governs the world by his providence. "That he ought to be worshiped by adoration, prayer, andthanksgiving. "But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to man. "That the soul is immortal. "And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice, eitherhere or hereafter." My ideas at that time were, that the sect should be begun and spreadat first among young and single men only; that each person to beinitiated should not only declare his assent to such creed, but shouldhave exercised himself with the thirteen weeks' examination andpractice of the virtues, as in the beforemention'd model; that theexistence of such a society should be kept a secret, till it wasbecome considerable, to prevent solicitations for the admission ofimproper persons, but that the members should each of them searchamong his acquaintance for ingenuous, well-disposed youths, to whom,with prudent caution, the scheme should be gradually communicated;that the members should engage to afford their advice, assistance, andsupport to each other in promoting one another's interests, business,and advancement in life; that, for distinction, we should be call'd_The Society of the Free and Easy_: free, as being, by the generalpractice and habit of the virtues, free from the dominion of vice;and particularly by the practice of industry and frugality, free fromdebt, which exposes a man to confinement, and a species of slavery tohis creditors. This is as much as I can now recollect of the project, except that Icommunicated it in part to two young men, who adopted it with someenthusiasm; but my then narrow circumstances, and the necessity I wasunder of sticking close to my business, occasioned my postponing thefurther prosecution of it at that time; and my multifariousoccupations, public and private, induc'd me to continue postponing, sothat it has been omitted till I have no longer strength or activityleft sufficient for such an enterprise; though I am still of opinionthat it was a practicable scheme, and might have been very useful, byforming a great number of good citizens; and I was not discourag'd bythe seeming magnitude of the undertaking, as I have always thoughtthat one man of tolerable abilities may work great changes, andaccomplish great affairs among mankind, if he first forms a good plan,and, cutting off all amusements or other employments that would diverthis attention, makes the execution of that same plan his sole studyand business. X POOR RICHARD'S ALMANAC ANDOTHER ACTIVITIES In 1732 I first publish'd my Almanack, under the name of _RichardSaunders_; it was continu'd by me about twenty-five years, commonlycall'd _Poor Richard's Almanac_. I endeavour'd to make it bothentertaining and useful, and it accordingly came to be in such demand,that I reap'd considerable profit from it, vending annually near tenthousand. And observing that it was generally read, scarce anyneighborhood in the province being without it, I consider'd it as aproper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common people, whobought scarcely any other books; I therefore filled all the littlespaces that occurr'd between the remarkable days in the calendar withproverbial sentences, chiefly such as inculcated industry andfrugality, as the means of procuring wealth, and thereby securingvirtue; it being more difficult for a man in want, to as, to use here one of those proverbs, _it is hard for anempty sack to stand upright_. The almanac at that time was a kind of periodical as well as a guide to natural phenomena and the weather. Franklin took his title from _Poor Robin_, a famous English almanac, and from Richard Saunders, a well-known almanac publisher. For the maxims of Poor Richard, see pages 331-335. These proverbs, which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations, Iassembled and form'd into a connected discourse prefix'd to the Almanackof 1757, as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending anauction. The bringing all these scatter'd councils thus into a focusenabled them to make greater impression. The piece, being universallyapproved, was copied in all the newspapers of the Continent; reprintedin Britain on a broadside, to be stuck up in houses; two translationswere made of it in French, and great numbers bought by the clergy andgentry, to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants.In Pennsylvania, as it discouraged useless expense in foreignsuperfluities, some thought it had its share of influence in producingthat growing plenty of money which was observable for several yearsafter its publication.

Of these are a Socratic dialogue, tending to prove that,whatever might be his parts and abilities, a vicious man could notproperly be called a man of sense; and a discourse on self-denial,showing that virtue was not secure till its practice became ahabitude, and was free from the opposition of contrary inclinations.These may be found in the papers about the beginning of 1735. June 23 and July 7, 1730.--Smyth. In the conduct of my newspaper, I carefully excluded all libeling andpersonal abuse, which is of late years become so disgraceful to ourcountry. Whenever I was solicited to insert anything of that kind, andthe writers pleaded, as they generally did, the liberty of the press,and that a newspaper was like a stage-coach, in which anyone who wouldpay had a right to a place, my answer was, that I would print thepiece separately if desired, and the author might have as many copiesas he pleased to distribute himself, but that I would not take upon meto spread his detraction; and that, having contracted with mysubscribers to furnish them with what might be either useful orentertaining, I could not fill their papers with private altercation,in which they had no concern, without doing them manifest injustice.Now, many of our printers make no scruple of gratifying the malice ofindividuals by false accusations of the fairest characters amongourselves, augmenting animosity even to the producing of duels; andare, moreover, so indiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on thegovernment of neighboring states, and even on the conduct of our bestnational allies, which may be attended with the most perniciousconsequences. These things I mention as a caution to young printers,and that they may be encouraged not to pollute their presses anddisgrace their profession by such infamous practices, but refusesteadily, as they may see by my example that such a course of conductwill not, on the whole, be injurious to their interests. In 1733 I sent one of my journeymen to Charleston, South Carolina,where a printer was wanting. I furnish'd him with a press and letters,on an agreement of partnership, by which I was to receive one-third ofthe profits of the business, paying one-third of the expense. He was aman of learning, and honest but ignorant in matters of account; and,tho' he sometimes made me remittances, I could get no account fromhim, nor any satisfactory state of our partnership while he lived. Onhis decease, the business was continued by his widow, who, being bornand bred in Holland, where, as I have been inform'd, the knowledge ofaccounts makes a part of female education, she not only sent me asclear a state as she could find of the transactions past, butcontinued to account with the greatest regularity and exactness everyquarter afterwards, and managed the business with such success, thatshe not only brought up reputably a family of children, but, at theexpiration of the term, was able to purchase of me the printing-house,and establish her son in it. I mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branchof education for our young females, as likely to be of more use tothem and their children, in case of widowhood, than either music ordancing, by preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men,and enabling them to continue, perhaps, a profitable mercantile house,with establish'd correspondence, till a son is grown up fit toundertake and go on with it, to the lasting advantage and enriching ofthe family. About the year 1734 there arrived among us from Ireland a youngPresbyterian preacher, named Hemphill, who delivered with a goodvoice, and apparently extempore, most excellent discourses, which drewtogether considerable numbers of different persuasions, who join'd inadmiring them. Among the rest, I became one of his constant hearers,his sermons pleasing me, as they had little of the dogmatical kind,but inculcated strongly the practice of virtue, or what in thereligious stile are called good works. Those, however, of ourcongregation, who considered themselves as orthodox Presbyterians,disapprov'd his doctrine, and were join'd by most of the old clergy,who arraign'd him of heterodoxy before the synod, in order to have himsilenc'd. I became his zealous partisan, and contributed all I couldto raise a party in his favour, and we combated for him awhile withsome hopes of success. There was much scribbling pro and con upon theoccasion; and finding that, tho' an elegant preacher, he was but apoor writer, I lent him my pen and wrote for him two or threepamphlets, and one piece in the Gazette of April, 1735. Thosepamphlets, as is generally the case with controversial writings, tho'eagerly read at the time, were soon out of vogue, and I questionwhether a single copy of them now exists. See "A List of Books written by, or relating to Benjamin Franklin," by Paul Leicester Ford. 1889. p. 15.--Smyth. During the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly.One of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that was muchadmired, thought he had somewhere read the sermon before, or at leasta part of it. On search, he found that part quoted at length, in oneof the British Reviews, from a discourse of Dr. Foster's. Thisdetection gave many of our party disgust, who accordingly abandonedhis cause, and occasion'd our more speedy discomfiture in the synod. Istuck by him, however, as I rather approv'd his giving us good sermonscomposed by others, than bad ones of his own manufacture, tho' thelatter was the practice of our common teachers. He afterwardacknowledg'd to me that none of those he preach'd were his own;adding, that his memory was such as enabled him to retain and repeatany sermon after one reading only. On our defeat, he left us in searchelsewhere of better fortune, and I quitted the congregation, neverjoining it after, tho' I continu'd many years my subscription for thesupport of its ministers. Dr. James Foster (1697-1753):-- "Let modest Foster, if he will excel Ten metropolitans in preaching well." --Pope (Epilogue to the Satires, I, 132). "Those who had not heard Farinelli sing and Foster preach were not qualified to appear in genteel company," Hawkins. "History of Music."--Smyth. I had begun in 1733 to study languages; I soon made myself so much amaster of the French as to be able to read the books with ease. I thenundertook the Italian. An acquaintance, who was also learning it, us'doften to tempt me to play chess with him. Finding this took up toomuch of the time I had to spare for study, I at length refus'd to playany more, unless on this condition, that the victor in every gameshould have a right to impose a task, either in parts of the grammarto be got by heart, or in translations, etc., which tasks thevanquish'd was to perform upon honour, before our next meeting. As weplay'd pretty equally, we thus beat one another into that language. Iafterwards with a little painstaking, acquir'd as much of the Spanishas to read their books also. I have already mention'd that I had only one year's instruction in aLatin school, and that when very young, after which I neglected thatlanguage entirely. But, when I had attained an acquaintance with theFrench, Italian, and Spanish, I was surpris'd to find, on looking overa Latin Testament, that I understood so much more of that languagethan I had imagined, which encouraged me to apply myself again to thestudy of it, and I met with more success, as those preceding languageshad greatly smooth'd my way. From these circumstances, I have thought that there is someinconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages. We are toldthat it is proper to begin first with the Latin, and, having acquir'dthat, it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which arederiv'd from it; and yet we do not begin with the Greek, in order moreeasily to acquire the Latin. It is true that, if you can clamber andget to the top of a staircase without using the steps, you will moreeasily gain them in descending; but certainly, if you begin with thelowest you will with more ease ascend to the top; and I wouldtherefore offer it to the consideration of those who superintend theeducation of our youth, whether, since many of those who begin withthe Latin quit the same after spending some years without having madeany great proficiency, and what they have learnt becomes almostuseless, so that their time has been lost, it would not have beenbetter to have begun with the French, proceeding to the Italian, etc.;for, tho', after spending the same time, they should quit the study oflanguages and never arrive at the Latin, they would, however, haveacquired another tongue or two, that, being in modern use, might beserviceable to them in common life. "The authority of Franklin, the most eminently practical man of his age, in favor of reserving the study of the dead languages until the mind has reached a certain maturity, is confirmed by the confession of one of the most eminent scholars of any age. "'Our seminaries of learning,' says Gibbon, 'do not exactly correspond with the precept of a Spartan king, that the child should be instructed in the arts which will be useful to the man; since a finished scholar may emerge from the head of Westminster or Eton, in total ignorance of the business and conversation of English gentlemen in the latter end of the eighteenth century. But these schools may assume the merit of teaching all that they pretend to teach, the Latin and Greek languages.'"--Bigelow. After ten years' absence from Boston, and having become easy in mycircumstances, I made a journey thither to visit my relations, which Icould not sooner well afford. In returning, I call'd at Newport to seemy brother, then settled there with his printing-house. Our formerdifferences were forgotten, and our meeting was very cordial andaffectionate. He was fast declining in his health, and requested of methat, in case of his death, which he apprehended not far distant, Iwould take home his son, then but ten years of age, and bring him upto the printing business. This I accordingly perform'd, sending him afew years to school before I took him into the office. His mothercarried on the business till he was grown up, when I assisted him withan assortment of new types, those of his father being in a manner wornout. Thus it was that I made my brother ample amends for the service Ihad depriv'd him of by leaving him so early. In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by thesmall-pox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, andstill regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This Imention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on thesupposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child diedunder it; my example showing that the regret may be the same eitherway, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen. Our club, the Junto, was found so useful, and afforded suchsatisfaction to the members, that several were desirous of introducingtheir friends, which could not well be done without exceeding what wehad settled as a convenient number, viz., twelve. We had from thebeginning made it a rule to keep our institution a secret, which waspretty well observ'd; the intention was to avoid applications ofimproper persons for admittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might findit difficult to refuse. I was one of those who were against anyaddition to our number, but, instead of it, made in writing aproposal, that every member separately should endeavour to form asubordinate club, with the same rules respecting queries, etc., andwithout informing them of the connection with the Junto. Theadvantages proposed were, the improvement of so many more youngcitizens by the use of our institutions; our better acquaintance withthe general sentiments of the inhabitants on any occasion, as theJunto member might propose what queries we should desire, and was toreport to the Junto what pass'd in his separate club; the promotion ofour particular interests in business by more extensive recommendation,and the increase of our influence in public affairs, and our power ofdoing good by spreading thro' the several clubs the sentiments of theJunto. The project was approv'd, and every member undertook to form his club,but they did not all succeed. Five or six only were compleated, whichwere called by different names, as the Vine, the Union, the Band, etc.They were useful to themselves, and afforded us a good deal ofamusement, information, and instruction, besides answering, in someconsiderable degree, our views of influencing the public opinion onparticular occasions, of which I shall give some instances in courseof time as they happened. My first promotion was my being chosen, in 1736, clerk of the GeneralAssembly. The choice was made that year without opposition; but theyear following, when I was again propos'd (the choice, like that ofthe members, being annual), a new member made a long speech againstme, in order to favour some other candidate. I was, however, chosen,which was the more agreeable to me, as, besides the pay for theimmediate service as clerk, the place gave me a better opportunity ofkeeping up an interest among the members, which secur'd to me thebusiness of printing the votes, laws, paper money, and otheroccasional jobbs for the public, that, on the whole, were veryprofitable. I therefore did not like the opposition of this new member, who was agentleman of fortune and education, with talents that were likely togive him, in time, great influence in the House, which, indeed,afterwards happened. I did not, however, aim at gaining his favour bypaying any servile respect to him, but, after some time, took thisother method. Having heard that he had in his library a certain veryscarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desireof perusing that book, and requesting he would do me the favour oflending it to me for a few days. He sent it immediately, and Ireturn'd it in about a week with another note, expressing strongly mysense of the favour. When we next met in the House, he spoke to me(which he had never done before), and with great civility; and he everafter manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that webecame great friends, and our friendship continued to his death. Thisis another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, whichsays, _"He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to doyou another, than he whom you yourself have obliged."_ And it showshow much more profitable it is prudently to remove, than to resent,return, and continue inimical proceedings. In 1737, Colonel Spotswood, late governor of Virginia, and thenpostmaster-general, being dissatisfied with the conduct of his deputyat Philadelphia, respecting some negligence in rendering, andinexactitude of his accounts, took from him the commission and offeredit to me. I accepted it readily, and found it of great advantage; for,tho' the salary was small, it facilitated the correspondence thatimprov'd my newspaper, increas'd the number demanded, as well as theadvertisements to be inserted, so that it came to afford me aconsiderable income. My old competitor's newspaper declin'dproportionately, and I was satisfy'd without retaliating his refusal,while postmaster, to permit my papers being carried by the riders.Thus he suffer'd greatly from his neglect in due accounting; and Imention it as a lesson to those young men who may be employ'd inmanaging affairs for others, that they should always render accounts,and make remittances, with great clearness and punctuality. Thecharacter of observing such a conduct is the most powerful of allrecommendations to new employments and increase of business. XI INTEREST IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS I began now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs, beginning,however, with small matters. The city watch was one of the firstthings that I conceiv'd to want regulation. It was managed by theconstables of the respective wards in turn; the constable warned anumber of housekeepers to attend him for the night. Those who chosenever to attend, paid him six shillings a year to be excus'd, whichwas suppos'd to be for hiring substitutes, but was, in reality, muchmore than was necessary for that purpose, and made the constableship aplace of profit; and the constable, for a little drink, often got suchragamuffins about him as a watch, that respectable housekeepers didnot choose to mix with. Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected,and most of the nights spent in tippling. I thereupon wrote a paper tobe read in Junto, representing these irregularities, but insistingmore particularly on the inequality of this six-shilling tax of theconstables, respecting the circumstances of those who paid it, since apoor widow housekeeper, all whose property to be guarded by the watchdid not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid as much as thewealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds' worth of goods inhis stores. On the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the hiring ofproper men to serve constantly in that business; and as a moreequitable way of supporting the charge, the levying a tax that shouldbe proportion'd to the property. This idea, being approv'd by theJunto, was communicated to the other clubs, but as arising in each ofthem; and though the plan was not immediately carried into execution,yet, by preparing the minds of people for the change, it paved the wayfor the law obtained a few years after, when the members of our clubswere grown into more influence. About this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in Junto, but it wasafterward publish'd) on the different accidents and carelessnesses bywhich houses were set on fire, with cautions against them, and meansproposed of avoiding them. This was much spoken of as a useful piece,and gave rise to a project, which soon followed it, of forming acompany for the more ready extinguishing of fires, and mutualassistance in removing and securing of goods when in danger.Associates in this scheme were presently found, amounting to thirty.Our articles of agreement oblig'd every member to keep always in goodorder, and fit for use, a certain number of leather buckets, withstrong bags and baskets (for packing and transporting of goods), whichwere to be brought to every fire; and we agreed to meet once a monthand spend a social evening together, in discoursing and communicatingsuch ideas as occurred to us upon the subjects of fires, as might beuseful in our conduct on such occasions. The utility of this institution soon appeared, and many more desiringto be admitted than we thought convenient for one company, they wereadvised to form another, which was accordingly done; and this went on,one new company being formed after another, till they became sonumerous as to include most of the inhabitants who were men ofproperty; and now, at the time of my writing this, tho' upward offifty years since its establishment, that which I first formed, calledthe Union Fire Company, still subsists and flourishes, tho' the firstmembers are all deceas'd but myself and one, who is older by a yearthan I am. The small fines that have been paid by members for absenceat the monthly meetings have been apply'd to the purchase offire-engines, ladders, fire-hooks, and other useful implements foreach company, so that I question whether there is a city in the worldbetter provided with the means of putting a stop to beginningconflagrations; and, in fact, since these institutions, the city hasnever lost by fire more than one or two houses at a time, and theflames have often been extinguished before the house in which theybegan has been half consumed. In 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr. Whitefield,who had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher. He wasat first permitted to preach in some of our churches; but the clergy,taking a dislike to him, soon refus'd him their pulpits, and he wasoblig'd to preach in the fields. The multitudes of all sects anddenominations that attended his sermons were enormous, and it wasmatter of speculation to me, who was one of the number, to observe theextraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers, and how muchthey admir'd and respected him, notwithstanding his common abuse ofthem, by assuring them they were naturally _half beasts and halfdevils_. It was wonderful to see the change soon made in the mannersof our inhabitants. From being thoughtless or indifferent aboutreligion, it seem'd as if all the world were growing religious, sothat one could not walk thro' the town in an evening without hearingpsalms sung in different families of every street. George Whitefield, pronounced Hwit'field (1714-1770), a celebrated English clergyman and pulpit orator, one of the founders of Methodism. And it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air, subjectto its inclemencies, the building of a house to meet in was no soonerpropos'd, and persons appointed to receive contributions, butsufficient sums were soon receiv'd to procure the ground and erect thebuilding, which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad, about thesize of Westminster Hall; and the work was carried on with suchspirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than could have beenexpected. Both house and ground were vested in trustees, expressly forthe use of any preacher of any religious persuasion who might desireto say something to the people at Philadelphia; the design in buildingnot being to accommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants ingeneral; so that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send amissionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit athis service. A part of the palace of Westminster, now forming the vestibule to the Houses of Parliament in London. Mr. Whitefield, in leaving us, went preaching all the way thro' thecolonies to Georgia. The settlement of that province had lately beenbegun, but, instead of being made with hardy, industrious husbandmen,accustomed to labour, the only people fit for such an enterprise, itwas with families of broken shop-keepers and other insolvent debtors,many of indolent and idle habits, taken out of the jails, who, beingset down in the woods, unqualified for clearing land, and unable toendure the hardships of a new settlement, perished in numbers, leavingmany helpless children unprovided for. The sight of their miserablesituation inspir'd the benevolent heart of Mr. Whitefield with theidea of building an Orphan House there, in which they might besupported and educated. Returning northward, he preach'd up thischarity, and made large collections, for his eloquence had a wonderfulpower over the hearts and purses of his hearers, of which I myself wasan instance. I did not disapprove of the design, but, as Georgia was then destituteof materials and workmen, and it was proposed to send them fromPhiladelphia at a great expense, I thought it would have been betterto have built the house here, and brought the children to it. This Iadvis'd; but he was resolute in his first project, rejected mycounsel, and I therefore refus'd to contribute. I happened soon afterto attend one of his sermons, in the course of which I perceived heintended to finish with a collection, and I silently resolved heshould get nothing from me. I had in my pocket a handful of coppermoney, three or four silver dollars, and five pistoles in gold. As heproceeded I began to soften, and concluded to give the coppers.Another stroke of his oratory made me asham'd of that, and determin'dme to give the silver; and he finish'd so admirably, that I empty'd mypocket wholly into the collector's dish, gold and all. At this sermonthere was also one of our club, who, being of my sentiments respectingthe building in Georgia, and suspecting a collection might beintended, had, by precaution, emptied his pockets before he came fromhome. Towards the conclusion of the discourse, however, he felt astrong desire to give, and apply'd to a neighbour who stood near him,to borrow some money for the purpose. The application wasunfortunately to perhaps the only man in the company who hadthe firmness not to be affected by the preacher. His answer was, "_Atany other time, Friend Hopkinson, I would lend to thee freely; but notnow, for thee seems to be out of thy right senses._" Some of Mr. Whitefield's enemies affected to suppose that he wouldapply these collections to his own private emolument; but I, who wasintimately acquainted with him (being employed in printing his Sermonsand Journals, etc.), never had the least suspicion of his integrity,but am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conducta perfectly _honest man_; and methinks my testimony in his favourought to have the more weight, as we had no religious connection. Heus'd, indeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion, but never had thesatisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard. Ours was a merecivil friendship, sincere on both sides, and lasted to his death. The following instance will show something of the terms on which westood. Upon one of his arrivals from England at Boston, he wrote to methat he should come soon to Philadelphia, but knew not where he couldlodge when there, as he understood his old friend and host, Mr.Benezet was removed to Germantown. My answer was, "You know my house;if you can make shift with its scanty accommodations, you will be mostheartily welcome." He reply'd, that if I made that kind offer forChrist's sake, I should not miss of a reward. And I returned, "_Don'tlet me be mistaken; it was not for Christ's sake, but for your sake._"One of our common acquaintance jocosely remark'd, that, knowing it tobe the custom of the saints, when they received any favour, to shiftthe burden of the obligation from off their own shoulders, and placeit in heaven, I had contriv'd to fix it on earth. The last time I saw Mr. Whitefield was in London, when he consulted meabout his Orphan House concern, and his purpose of appropriating it tothe establishment of a college. He had a loud and clear voice, and articulated his words and sentencesso perfectly, that he might be heard and understood at a greatdistance, especially as his auditories, however numerous, observ'd themost exHe preach'd one evening from the top of theCourthouse steps, which are in the middle of Market-street, and on thewest side of Second-street, which crosses it at right angles. Bothstreets were fill'd with his hearers to a considerable distance. Beingamong the hindmost in Market-street, I had the curiosity to learn howfar he could be heard, by retiring backwards down the street towardsthe river; and I found his voice distinct till I came nearFront-street, when some noise in that street obscur'd it. Imaginingthen a semicircle, of which my distance should be the radius, and thatit were fill'd with auditors, to each of whom I allow'd two squarefeet, I computed that he might well be heard by more than thirtythousand. This reconcil'd me to the newspaper accounts of his havingpreach'd to twenty-five thousand people in the fields, and to theancient histories of generals haranguing whole armies, of which I hadsometimes doubted. By hearing him often, I came to distinguish easily between sermonsnewly compos'd, and those which he had often preach'd in the course ofhis travels. His delivery of the latter was so improv'd by frequentrepetitions that every accent, every emphasis, every modulation ofvoice, was so perfectly well turn'd and well plac'd, that, withoutbeing interested in the subject, one could not help being pleas'd withthe discourse; a pleasure of much the same kind with that receiv'dfrom an excellent piece of musick. This is an advantage itinerantpreachers have over those who are stationary, as the latter cannotwell improve their delivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals. His writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage to hisenemies; unguarded expressions, and even erroneous opinions, deliveredin preaching, might have been afterwards explain'd or qualifi'd bysupposing others that might have accompani'd them, or they might havebeen deny'd; but _litera scripta manet_. Critics attack'd his writingsviolently, and with so much appearance of reason as to diminish thenumber of his votaries and prevent their increase; so that I am ofopinion if he had never written anything, he would have left behindhim a much more numerous and important sect, and his reputation mightin that case have been still growing, even after his death, as therebeing nothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give hima lower character, his proselytes would be left at liberty to feignfor him as great a variety of excellences as their enthusiasticadmiration might wish him to have possessed. My business was now continually augmenting, and my circumstancesgrowing daily easier, my newspaper having become very profitable, asbeing for a time almost the only one in this and the neighbouringprovinces. I experienced, too, the truth of the observation, "_thatafter getting the first hundred pound, it is more easy to get thesecond_," money itself being of a prolific nature. The partnership at Carolina having succeeded, I was encourag'd toengage in others, and to promote several of my workmen, who hadbehaved well, by establishing them with printing-houses in differentcolonies, on the same terms with that in Carolina. Most of them didwell, being enabled at the end of our term, six years, to purchase thetypes of me and go on working for themselves, by which means severalfamilies were raised. Partnerships often finish in quarrels; but I washappy in this, that mine were all carried on and ended amicably,owing, I think, a good deal to the precaution of having veryexplicitly settled, in our articles, everything to be done by orexpected from each partner, so that there was nothing to dispute,which precaution I would therefore recommend to all who enter intopartnerships; for, whatever esteem partners may have for, andconfidence in each other at the time of the contract, littlejealousies and disgusts may arise, with ideas of inequality in thecare and burden of the business, etc., which are attended often withbreach of friendship and of the connection, perhaps with lawsuits andother disagreeable consequences. XII DEFENSE OF THE PROVINCE I had, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with my beingestablished in Pennsylvania. There were, however, two, things that Iregretted, there being no provision for defense, nor for a compleateducation of youth; no militia, nor any college. I therefore, in 1743,drew up a proposal for establishing an academy; and at that time,thinking the Reverend Mr. Peters, who was out of employ, a fit personto superintend such an institution, I communicated the project to him;but he, having more profitable views in the service of theproprietaries, which succeeded, declin'd the undertaking; and, notknowing another at that time suitable for such a trust, I let thescheme lie awhile dormant. I succeeded better the next year, 1744, inproposing and establishing a Philosophical Society. The paper I wrotefor that purpose will be found among my writings, when collected. With respect to defense, Spain having been several years at waragainst Great Britain, and being at length join'd by France, whichbrought us into great danger; and the laboured and long-continuedendeavour of our governor, Thomas, to prevail with our Quaker Assemblyto pass a militia law, and make other provisions for the security ofthe province, having proved abortive, I determined to try what mightbe done by a voluntary association of the people. To promote this, Ifirst wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled Plain Truth, in which Istated our defenceless situation in strong lights, with the necessityof union and discipline for our defense, and promis'd to propose in afew days an association, to be generally signed for that purpose. Thepamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect. I was call'd upon for theinstrument of association, and having settled the draft of it with afew friends, I appointed a meeting of the citizens in the largebuilding before mentioned. The house was pretty full; I had prepared anumber of printed copies, and provided pens and ink dispers'd all overthe room. I harangued them a little on the subject, read the paper,and explained it, and then distributed the copies, which were eagerlysigned, not the least objection being made. When the company separated, and the papers were collected, we foundabove twelve hundred hands; and, other copies being dispersed in thecountry, the subscribers amounted at length to upward of ten thousand.These all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms, formedthemselves into companies and regiments, chose their own officers, andmet every week to be instructed in the manual exercise, and otherparts of military discipline. The women, by subscriptions amongthemselves, provided silk colours, which they presented to thecompanies, painted with different devices and mottos, which Isupplied. The officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia regiment,being met, chose me for their colonel; but, conceiving myself unfit, Ideclin'd that station, and recommended Mr. Lawrence, a fine person,and man of influence, who was accordingly appointed. I then propos'd alottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town,and furnishing it with cannon. It filled expeditiously, and thebattery was soon erected, the merlons being fram'd of logs and fill'dwith earth. We bought some old cannon from Boston, but, these notbeing sufficient, we wrote to England for more, soliciting, at thesame time, our proprietaries for some assistance, tho' without muchexpectation of obtaining it. Meanwhile, Colonel Lawrence, William Allen, Abram Taylor, Esqr., andmyself were sent to New York by the associators, commission'd toborrow some cannon of Governor Clinton. He at first refus'd usperemptorily; but at dinner with his council, where there was greatdrinking of Madeira wine, as the custom of that place then was, hesoftened by degrees, and said he would lend us six. After a few morebumpers he advanc'd to ten; and at length he very good-naturedlyconceded eighteen. They were fine cannon, eighteen-pounders, withtheir carriages, which we soon transported and mounted on our battery,where the associators kept a nightly guard while the war lasted, andamong the rest I regularly took my turn of duty there as a commonsoldier. My activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor andcouncil; they took me into confidence, and I was consulted by them inevery measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to theassociation. Calling in the aid of religion, I propos'd to them theproclaiming a fast, to promote reformation, and implore the blessingof Heaven on our undertaking. They embrac'd the motion; but, as it wasthe first fast ever thought of in the province, the secretary had noprecedent from which to draw the proclamation. My education in NewEngland, where a fast is proclaimed every year, was here of someadvantage: I drew it in the accustomed stile, it was translated intoGerman, printed in both languages, and divulg'd thro' the province.This gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity ofinfluencing their congregations to join in the association, and itwould probably have been general among all but Quakers if the peacehad not soon interven'd. Wm. Penn's agents sought recruits for the colony of Pennsylvania in the low countries of Germany, and there are still in eastern Pennsylvania many Germans, inaccurately called Pennsylvania Dutch. Many of them use a Germanized English. It was thought by some of my friends that, by my activity in theseaffairs, I should offend that sect, and thereby lose my interest inthe Assembly of the province, where they formed a great majority. Ayoung gentleman who had likewise some friends in the House, and wishedto succeed me as their clerk, acquainted me that it was decided todisplace me at the next election; and he, therefore, in good will,advis'd me to resign, as more consistent with my honour than beingturn'd out. My answer to him was, that I had read or heard of somepublic man who made it a rule never to ask for an office, and never torefuse one when offer'd to him. "I approve," says I, "of his rule, andwill practice it with a small addition; I shall never _ask_, never_refuse_, nor ever _resign_ an office. If they will have my office ofclerk to dispose of to another, they shall take it from me. I willnot, by giving it up, lose my right of some time or other makingreprisals on my adversaries." I heard, however, no more of this; I waschosen again unanimously as usual at the next election. Possibly, asthey dislik'd my late intimacy with the members of council, who hadjoin'd the governors in all the disputes about military preparations,with which the House had long been harass'd, they might have beenpleas'd if I would voluntarily have left them; but they did not careto displace me on account merely of my zeal for the association, andthey could not well give another reason. Indeed I had some cause to believe that the defense of the country wasnot disagreeable to any of them, provided they were not requir'd toassist in it. And I found that a much greater number of them than Icould have imagined, tho' against offensive war, were clearly for thedefensive. Many pamphlets _pro and con_ were publish'd on the subject,and some by good Quakers, in favour of defense, which I believeconvinc'd most of their younger people. A transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into theirprevailing sentiments. It had been propos'd that we should encouragethe scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock,then about sixty pounds, in tickets of the lottery. By our rules, nomoney could be dispos'd of till the next meeting after the proposal.The company consisted of thirty members, of which twenty-two wereQuakers, and eight only of other persuasions. We eight punctuallyattended the meeting; but, tho' we thought that some of the Quakerswould join us, we were by no means sure of a majority. Only oneQuaker, Mr. James Morris, appear'd to oppose the measure. He expressedmuch sorrow that it had ever been propos'd, as he said _Friends_ wereall against it, and it would create such discord as might break up thecompany. We told him that we saw no reason for that; we were theminority, and if _Friends_ were against the measure, and outvoted us,we must and should, agreeably to the usage of all societies, submit.When the hour for business arriv'd it was mov'd to put the vote; heallow'd we might then do it by the rules, but, as he could assure usthat a number of members intended to be present for the purpose ofopposing it, it would be but candid to allow a little time for theirappearing. While we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me two gentlemenbelow desir'd to speak with me. I went down, and found they were twoof our Quaker members. They told me there were eight of them assembledat a tavern just by; that they were determin'd to come and vote withus if there should be occasion, which they hop'd would not be thecase, and desir'd we would not call for their assistance if we coulddo without it, as their voting for such a measure might embroil themwith their elders and friends. Being thus secure of a majority, I wentup, and after a little seeming hesitation, agreed to a delay ofanother hour. This Mr. Morris allow'd to be extreamly fair. Not one ofhis opposing friends appear'd, at which he express'd great surprize;and, at the expiration of the hour, we carri'd the resolution eight toone; and as, of the twenty-two Quakers, eight were ready to vote withus, and thirteen, by their absence, manifested that they were notinclin'd to oppose the measure, I afterward estimated the proportionof Quakers sincerely against defense as one to twenty-one only; forthese were all regular members of that society, and in good reputationamong them, and had due notice of what was propos'd at that meeting. The honorable and learned Mr. Logan, who had always been of that sect,was one who wrote an address to them, declaring his approbation ofdefensive war, and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments. Heput into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets forthe battery, with directions to apply what prizes might be drawnwholly to that service. He told me the following anecdote of his oldmaster, William Penn, respecting defense. He came over from England,when a young man, with that proprietary, and as his secretary. It waswar-time, and their ship was chas'd by an armed vessel, suppos'd to bean enemy. Their captain prepar'd for defense; but told William Penn,and his company of Quakers, that he did not expect their assistance,and they might retire into the cabin, which they did, except JamesLogan, who chose to stay upon deck, and was quarter'd to a gun. Thesuppos'd enemy prov'd a friend, so there was no fighting; but when thesecretary went down to communicate the intelligence, William Pennrebuk'd him severely for staying upon deck, and undertaking to assistin defending the vessel, contrary to the principles of _Friends_,especially as it had not been required by the captain. This reproof,being before all the company, piqu'd the secretary, who answer'd, _"Ibeing thy servant, why did thee not order me to come down? But theewas willing enough that I should stay and help to fight the ship whenthee thought there was danger."_ James Logan (1674-1751) came to America with William Penn in 1699, and was the business agent for the Penn family. He bequeathed his valuable library, preserved at his country seat, "Senton", to the city of Philadelphia.--Smyth. My being many years in the Assembly, the majority of which wereconstantly Quakers, gave me frequent opportunities of seeing theembarrassment given them by their principle against war, wheneverapplication was made to them, by order of the crown, to grant aids formilitary purposes. They were unwilling to offend government, on theone hand, by a direct refusal; and their friends, the body of theQuakers, on the other, by compliance contrary to their principles;hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying, and modes ofdisguising the compliance when it became unavoidable. The common modeat last was, to grant money under the phrase of its being "_for theking's use_," and never to inquire how it was applied. But, if the demand was not directly from the crown, that phrase wasfound not so proper, and some other was to be invented. As, whenpowder was wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg), andthe government of New England solicited a grant of some fromPennsylvania, which was much urg'd on the House by Governor Thomas,they could not grant money to buy powder, because that was aningredient of war; but they voted an aid to New England of threethousand pounds, to be put into the hands of the governor, andappropriated it for the purchasing of bread, flour, wheat or _othergrain_. Some of the council, desirous of giving the House stillfurther embarrassment, advis'd the governor not to accept provision,as not being the thing he had demanded; but he repli'd, "I shall takethe money, for I understand very well their meaning; other grain isgunpowder," which he accordingly bought, and they never objected toit. See the votes.--_Marg. note_. It was in allusion to this fwhen in our fire company wefeared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery, and I hadsaid to my friend Mr. Syng, one of our members, "If we fail, let usmove the purchase of a fire-engine with the money; the Quakers canhave no objection to that; and then, if you nominate me and I you as acommittee for that purpose, we will buy a great gun, which iscertainly a _fire-engine_." "I see," says he, "you have improv'd bybeing so long in the Assembly; your equivocal project would be just amatch for their wheat or _other grain_." These embarrassments that the Quakers suffer'd from having establish'dand published it as one of their principles that no kind of war waslawful, and which, being once published, they could not afterwards,however they might change their minds, easily get rid of, reminds meof what I think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us, thatof the Dunkers. I was acquainted with one of its founders, MichaelWelfare, soon after it appear'd. He complain'd to me that they weregrievously calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions, andcharg'd with abominable principles and practices to which they wereutter strangers. I told him this had always been the case with newsects, and that, to put a stop to such abuse, I imagin'd it might bewell to publish the articles of their belief, and the rules of theirdiscipline. He said that it had been propos'd among them, but notagreed to, for this reason: "When we were first drawn together as asociety," says he, "it had pleased God to enlighten our minds so faras to see that some doctrines, which we once esteemed truths, wereerrors; and that others, which we had esteemed errors, were realtruths. From time to time He has been pleased to afford us fartherlight, and our principles have been improving, and our errorsdiminishing. Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end ofthis progression, and at the perfection of spiritual or theologicalknowledge; and we fear that, if we should once print our confession offaith, we should feel ourselves as if bound and confin'd by it, andperhaps be unwilling to receive further improvement, and oursuccessors still more so, as conceiving what we their elders andfounders had done, to be something sacred, never to be departed from." This modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the historyof mankind, every other sect supposing itself in possession of alltruth, and that those who differ are so far in the wrong; like a mantraveling in foggy weather, those at some distance before him on theroad he sees wrapped up in the fog, as well as those behind him, andalso the people in the fields on each side, but near him all appearsclear, tho' in truth he is as much in the fog as any of them. To avoidthis kind of embarrassment, the Quakers have of late years beengradually declining the public service in the Assembly and in themagistracy, choosing rather to quit their power than their principle. In order of time, I should have mentioned before, that having, in1742, invented an open stove for the better warming of rooms, andat the same time saving fuel, as the fresh air admitted was warmed inentering, I made a present of the model to Mr. Robert Grace, one of myearly friends, who, having an iron-furnace, found the casting ofthe plates for these stoves a profitable thing, as they were growingin demand. To promote that demand, I wrote and published a pamphlet,entitled "_An Account of the new-invented Pennsylvania Fireplaces;wherein their Construction and Manner of Operation is particularlyexplained; their Advantages above every other Method of warming Roomsdemonstrated; and all Objections that have been raised against the Useof them answered and obviated_," etc. This pamphlet had a good effect.Gov'r. Thomas was so pleas'd with the construction of this stove, asdescribed in it, that he offered to give me a patent for the solevending of them for a term of years; but I declin'd it from aprinciple which has ever weighed with me on such occasions, viz.,_That, as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, weshould be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention ofours; and this we should do freely and generously._ The Franklin stove is still in use. Warwick Furnace, Chester County, Pennsylvania, across the Schuylkill River from Pottstown. An ironmonger in London however, assuming a good deal of my pamphlet,and working it up into his own, and making some small changes in themachine, which rather hurt its operation, got a patent for it there,and made, as I was told, a little fortune by it. And this is not theonly instance of patents taken out for my inventions by others, tho'not always with the same success, which I never contested, as havingno desire of profiting by patents myself, and hating disputes. The useof these fireplaces in very many houses, both of this and theneighbouring colonies, has been, and is, a great saving of wood to theinhabitants. XIII PUBLIC SERVICES AND DUTIES (1749-1753) Peace being concluded, and the association business therefore at anend, I turn'd my thoughts again to the affair of establishing anacademy. The first step I took was to associate in the design a numberof active friends, of whom the Junto furnished a good part; the nextwas to write and publish a pamphlet, entitled _Proposals Relating tothe Education of Youth in Pennsylvania_. This I distributed among theprincipal inhabitants gratis; and as soon as I could suppose theirminds a little prepared by the perusal of it, I set on foot asubscription for opening and supporting an academy; it was to be paidin quotas yearly for five years; by so dividing it, I judg'd thesubscription might be larger, and I believe it was so, amounting to noless, if I remember right, than five thousand pounds. In the introduction to these proposals, I stated their publication,not as an mine, but of some _publick-spirited gentlemen_,avoiding as much as I could, according to my usual rule, thepresenting myself to the publick as the author of any scheme for theirbenefit. The subscribers, to carry the project into immediate execution, choseout of their number twenty-four trustees, and appointed Mr.Francis, then attorney-general, and myself to draw up constitutionsfor the government of the academy; which being done and signed, ahouse was hired, masters engag'd, and the schools opened, I think, inthe same year, 1749. Tench Francis, uncle of Sir Philip Francis, emigrated from England to Maryland, and became attorney for Lord Baltimore. He removed to Philadelphia and was attorney-general of Pennsylvania from 1741 to 1755. He died in Philadelphia August 16, 1758.--Smyth. The scholars increasing fast, the house was soon found too small, andwe were looking out for a piece of ground, properly situated, withintention to build, when Providence threw into our way a large houseready built, which, with a few alterations, might well serve ourpurpose. This was the building before mentioned, erected by thehearers of Mr. Whitefield, and was obtained for us in the followingmanner. It is to be noted that the contributions to this building being madeby people of different sects, care was taken in the nomination oftrustees, in whom the building and ground was to be vested, that apredominancy should not be given to any sect, lest in time thatpredominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the use ofsuch sect, contrary to the original intention. It was therefore thatone of each sect was appointed, viz., one Church-of-England man, onePresbyterian, one Baptist, one Moravian, etc., those, in case ofvacancy by death, were to fill it by election from among thecontributors. The Moravian happen'd not to please his colleagues, andon his death they resolved to have no other of that sect. Thedifficulty then was, how to avoid having two of some other sect, bymeans of the new choice. Several persons were named, and for that reason not agreed to. Atlength one mention'd me, with the observation that I was merely anhonest man, and of no sect at all, which prevailed with them to chuseme. The enthusiasm which existed when the house was built had longsince abat'd, and its trustees had not been able to procure freshcontributions for paying the ground-rent, and discharging some otherdebts the building had occasion'd, which embarrass'd them greatly.Being now a member of both sets of trustees, that for the building andthat for the academy, I had a good opportunity of negotiating withboth, and brought them finally to an agreement, by which the trusteesfor the building were to cede it to those of the academy, the latterundertaking to discharge the debt, to keep forever open in thebuilding a large hall for occasional preachers, according to theoriginal intention, and maintain a free-school for the instruction ofpoor children. Writings were accordingly drawn, and on paying thedebts the trustees of the academy were put in possession of thepremises; and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories, anddifferent rooms above and below for the several schools, andpurchasing some additional ground, the whole was soon made fit for ourpurpose, and the scholars remov'd into the building. The care andtrouble of agreeing with the workmen, purchasing materials, andsuperintending the work, fell upon me; and I went thro' it the morecheerfully, as it did not then interfere with my private business,having the year before taken a very able, industrious, and honestpartner, Mr. David Hall, with whose character I was well acquainted,as he had work'd for me four years. He took off my hands all care ofthe printing-office, paying me punctually my share of the profits. Thepartnership continued eighteen years, successfully for us both. The trustees of the academy, after a while, were incorporated by acharter from the governor; their funds were increas'd by contributionsin Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries, to which theAssembly has since made considerable addition; and thus wasestablished the present University of Philadelphia. I have beencontinued one of its trustees from the beginning, now near fortyyears, and have had the very great pleasure of seeing a number of theyouth who have receiv'd their education in it, distinguish'd by theirimprov'd abilities, serviceable in public stations, and ornaments totheir country. Later called the University of Pennsylvania. When I disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from private business, Iflatter'd myself that, by the sufficient tho' moderate fortune I hadacquir'd, I had secured leisure during the rest of my life forphilosophical studies and amusements. I purchased all Dr. Spence'sapparatus, who had come from England to lecture here, and I proceededin my electrical experiments with great alacrity; but the publick, nowconsidering me as a man of leisure, laid hold of me for theirpurposes, every part of our civil government, and almost at the sametime, imposing some duty upon me. The governor put me into thecommission of the peace; the corporation of the city chose me of thecommon council, and soon after an alderman; and the citizens at largechose me a burgess to represent them in Assembly. This latter stationwas the more agreeable to me, as I was at length tired with sittingthere to hear debates, in which, as clerk, I could take no part, andwhich were often so unentertaining that I was induc'd to amuse myselfwith making magic squares or circles, or anything to avoid weariness;and I conceiv'd my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doinggood. I would not, however, insinuate that my ambition was notflatter'd by all these promotions; it certainly was; for, consideringmy low beginning, they were great things to me; and they were stillmore pleasing, as being so many spontaneous testimonies of the publicgood opinion, and by me entirely unsolicited. The office of justice of the peace I try'd a little, by attending afew courts, and sitting on the bench to hear causes; but finding thatmore knowledge of the common law than I possess'd was necessary to actin that station with credit, I gradually withdrew from it, excusingmyself by my being oblig'd to attend the higher duties of a legislatorin the Assembly. My election to this trust was repeated every year forten years, without my ever asking any elector for his vote, orsignifying, either directly or indirectly, any desire of being chosen.On taking my seat in the House, my son was appointed their clerk. The year following, a treaty being to be held with the Indians atCarlisle, the governor sent a message to the House, proposing thatthey should nominate some of their members, to be join'd with somemembers of council, as commissioners for that purpose. The Housenamed the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself; and, being commission'd, wewent to Carlisle, and met the Indians accordingly. See the votes to have this more correctly.--_Marg. note._ As those people are extreamly apt to get drunk, and, when so, are veryquarrelsome and disorderly, we strictly forbade the selling anyliquor to them; and when they complain'd of this restriction, we toldthem that if they would continue sober during the treaty, we wouldgive them plenty of rum when business was over. They promis'd this,and they kept their promise, because they could get no liquor, and thetreaty was conducted very orderly, and concluded to mutualsatisfaction. They then claim'd and received the rum; this was in theafternoon: they were near one hundred men, women, and children, andwere lodg'd in temporary cabins, built in the form of a square, justwithout the town. In the evening, hearing a great noise among them,the commissioners walk'd out to see what was the matter. We found theyhad made a great bonfire in the middle of the square; they were alldrunk, men and women, quarreling and fighting. Their dark-colour'dbodies, half naked, seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire,running after and beating one another with firebrands, accompanied bytheir horrid yellings, form'd a most resembling our ideas ofhell that could well be imagin'd; there was no appeasing the tumult,and we retired to our lodging. At midnight a number of them camethundering at our door, demanding more rum, of which we took nonotice. The next day, sensible they had misbehav'd in giving us thatdisturbance, they sent three of their old counselors to make theirapology. The orator acknowledg'd the fault, but laid it upon the rum;and then endeavoured to excuse the rum by saying, "_The Great Spirit,who made all things, made everything for some use, and whatever use hedesign'd anything for, that use it should always be put to. Now, when__he made rum, he said, 'Let this be for the Indians to get drunkwith,' and it must be so._" And, indeed, if it be the design ofProvidence to extirpate these savages in order to make room forcultivators of the earth, it seems not improbable that rum may be theappointed means. It has already annihilated all the tribes whoformerly inhabited the sea-coast. In 1751, Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine, conceived theidea of establishing a hospital in Philadelphia (a very beneficentdesign, which has been ascrib'd to me, but was originally his), forthe reception and cure of poor sick persons, whether inhabitants ofthe province or strangers. He was zealous and active in endeavouringto procure subscriptions for it, but the proposal being a novelty inAmerica, and at first not well understood, he met but with smallsuccess. At length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was nosuch thing as carrying a public-spirited project through without mybeing concern'd in it. "For," says he, "I am often ask'd by those towhom I propose subscribing, Have you consulted Franklin upon thisbusiness? And what does he think of it? And when I tell them that Ihave not (supposing it rather out of your line), they do notsubscribe, but say they will consider of it." I enquired into thenature and probable utility of his scheme, and receiving from him avery satisfactory explanation, I not only subscrib'd to it myself, butengag'd heartily in the design of procuring subscriptions from others.Previously, however, to the solicitation, I endeavoured to prepare theminds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers, whichwas my usual custom in such cases, but which he had omitted. The subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous; but,beginning to flag, I saw they would be insufficient without someassistance from the Assembly, and therefore propos'd to petition forit, which was done. The country members did not at first relish theproject; they objected that it could only be serviceable to the city,and therefore the citizens alone should be at the expense of it; andthey doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approv'd of it.My allegation on the contrary, that it met with such approbation as toleave no doubt of our being able to raise two thousand pounds byvoluntary donations, they considered as a most extravagantsupposition, and utterly impossible. On this I form'd my plan; and, asking leave to bring in a bill forincorporating the contributors according to the prayer of theirpetition, and granting them a blank sum of money, which leave wasobtained chiefly on the consideration that the House could throw thebill out if they did not like it, I drew it so as to make theimportant clause a conditional one, viz., "And be it enacted, by theauthority aforesaid, that when the said contributors shall have metand chosen their managers and treasurer, _and shall have raised bytheir contributions a capital stock of----value_ (the yearlyinterest of which is to be applied to the accommodating of thesick poor in the said hospital, free of charge for diet, attendance,advice, and medicines), _and shall make the same appear to thesatisfaction of the speaker of the Assembly for the time being_, that_then_ it shall and may be lawful for the said speaker, and he ishereby required, to sign an order on the provincial treasurer for thepayment of two thousand pounds, in two yearly payments, to thetreasurer of the said hospital, to be applied to the founding,building, and finishing of the same." This condition carried the bill through; for the members, who hadoppos'd the grant, and now conceiv'd they might have the credit ofbeing charitable without the expense, agreed to its passage; and then,in soliciting subscriptions among the people, we urg'd the conditionalpromise of the law as an additional motive to give, since every man'sdonation would be doubled; thus the clause work'd both ways. Thesubscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum, and weclaim'd and receiv'd the public gift, which enabled us to carry thedesign into execution. A convenient and handsome building was soonerected; the institution has by constant experience been found useful,and flourishes to this day; and I do not remember any of my politicalmanoeuvers, the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure,or wherein, after thinking of it, I more easily excus'd myself forhaving made some use of cunning. It was about this time that another projector, the Rev. GilbertTennent, came to me with a request that I would assist him inprocuring a subscription for erecting a new meeting-house. It was tobe for the use of a congregation he had gathered among thePresbyterians, who were originally disciples of Mr. Whitefield.Unwilling to make myself disagreeable to my fellow-citizens by toofrequently soliciting their contributions, I absolutely refus'd. Hethen desired I would furnish him with a list of the names of persons Iknew by experience to be generous and public-spirited. I thought itwould be unbecoming in me, after their kind compliance with mysolicitations, to mark them out to be worried by other beggars, andtherefore refus'd also to give such a list. He then desir'd I would atleast give him my advice. "That I will readily do," said I; "and, inthe first place, I advise you to apply to all those whom you know willgive something; next, to those whom you are uncertain whether theywill give anything or not, and show them the list of those who havegiven; and, lastly, do not neglect those who you are sure will givenothing, for in some of them you may be mistaken." He laugh'd andthank'd me, and said he would take my advice. He did so, for he ask'dof _everybody_, and he obtain'd a much larger sum than he expected,with which he erected the capacious and very elegant meeting-housethat stands in Arch-street. Gilbert Tennent (1703-1764) came to America with his father, Rev. William Tennent, and taught for a time in the "Log College," from which sprang the College of New Jersey.--Smyth. Our city, tho' laid out with a beautiful regularity, the streetslarge, straight, and crossing each other at right angles, had thedisgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpav'd, and in wetweather the wheels of heavy carriages plough'd them into a quagmire,so that it was difficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dustwas offensive. I had liv'd near what was call'd the Jersey Market, andsaw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing theirprovisions. A strip of ground down the middle of that market was atlength pav'd with brick, so that, being once in the market, they hadfirm footing, but were often over shoes in dirt to get there. Bytalking and writing on the subject, I was at length instrumental ingetting the street pav'd with stone between the market and the brick'dfoot-pavement, that was on each side next the houses. This, for sometime, gave an easy access to the market dry-shod; but, the rest of thestreet not being pav'd, whenever a carriage came out of the mud uponthis pavement, it shook off and left its dirt upon it, and it was sooncover'd with mire, which was not remov'd, the city as yet having noscavengers. After some inquiry, I found a poor, industrious man, who was willingto undertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twice a week,carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours' doors, for thesum of sixpence per month, to be paid by each house. I then wrote andprinted a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood thatmight be obtain'd by this small expense; the greater ease in keepingour houses clean, so much dirt not being brought in by people's feet;the benefit to the shops by more custom, etc., etc., as buyers couldmore easily get at them; and by not having, in windy weather, the dustblown in upon their goods, etc., etc. I sent one of these papers toeach house, and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribean agreement to pay these sixpences; it was unanimously sign'd, andfor a time well executed. All the inhabitants of the city weredelighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded themarket, it being a convenience to all, and this rais'd a generaldesire to have all the streets paved, and made the people more willingto submit to a tax for that purpose. After some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and brought it intothe Assembly. It was just before I went to England, in 1757, and didnot pass till I was gone, and then with an alteration in the modeof assessment, which I thought not for the better, but with anadditional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets, whichwas a great improvement. It was by a private person, the late Mr. JohnClifton, his giving a sample of the utility of lamps, by placing oneat his door, that the people were first impress'd with the idea ofenlighting all the city. The honour of this public benefit has alsobeen ascrib'd to me, but it belongs truly to that gentleman. I did butfollow his example, and have only some merit to claim respecting theform of our lamps, as differing from the globe lamps we were at firstsupply'd with from London. Those we found inconvenient in theserespects: they admitted no air below; the smoke, therefore, did notreadily go out above, but circulated in the globe, lodg'd on itsinside, and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford;giving, besides, the daily trouble of wiping them clean; and anaccidental stroke on one of them would demolish it, and render ittotally useless. I therefore suggested the composing them of four flatpanes, with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke, and crevicesadmitting air below, to facilitate the ascent of the smoke; by thismeans they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours, asthe London lamps do, but continu'd bright till morning, and anaccidental stroke would generally break but a single pane, easilyrepair'd. I have sometimes wonder'd that the Londoners did not, from the effectholes in the bottom of the globe lamps us'd at Vauxhall have inkeeping them clean, learn to have such holes in their street lamps.But, these holes being made for another purpose, viz., to communicateflame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro'them, the other use, of letting in air, seems not to have been thoughtof; and therefore, after the lamps have been lit a few hours, thestreets of London are very poorly illuminated. See votes. Vauxhall Gardens, once a popular and fashionable London resort, situated on the Thames above Lambeth. The Gardens were closed in 1859, but they will always be remembered because of Sir Roger de Coverley's visit to them in the _Spectator_ and from the descriptions in Smollett's _Humphry Clinker_ and Thackeray's _Vanity Fair_. The mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I propos'd,when in London, to Dr. Fothergill, who was among the best men I haveknown, and a great promoter of useful projects. I had observ'd thatthe streets, when dry, were never swept, and the light dust carriedaway; but it was suffer'd to accumulate till wet weather reduc'd it tomud, and then, after lying some days so deep on the pavement thatthere was no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people withbrooms, it was with great labour rak'd together and thrown up intocarts open above, the sides of which suffered some of the slush atevery jolt on the pavement to shake out and fall, sometimes to theannoyance of foot-passengers. The reason given for not sweeping thedusty streets was that the dust would fly into the windows of shopsand houses. An accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might bedone in a little time. I found at my door in Craven-street, onemorning, a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom; sheappeared very pale and feeble, as just come out of a fit of sickness.I ask'd who employ'd her to sweep there; she said, "Nobody, but I amvery poor and in distress, and I sweeps before gentle-folkses doors,and hopes they will give me something." I bid her sweep the wholestreet clean, and I would give her a shilling; this was at nineo'clock; at 12 she came for the shilling. From the slowness I saw atfirst in her working, I could scarce believe that the work was done sosoon, and sent my servant to examine it, who reported that the wholestreet was swept perfectly clean, and all the dust plac'd in thegutter, which was in the middle; and the next rain wash'd it quiteaway, so that the pavement and even the kennel were perfectly clean. A short street near Charing Cross, London. I then judg'd that, if that feeble woman could sweep such a street inthree hours, a strong, active man might have done it in half the time.And here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter insuch a narrow street, running down its middle, instead of two, one oneach side, near the footway; for where all the rain that falls on astreet runs from the sides and meets in the middle, it forms there acurrent strong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with; but whendivided into two channels, it is often too weak to cleanse either, andonly makes the mud it finds more fluid, so that the wheels ofcarriages and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the foot-pavement,which is thereby rendered foul and slippery, and sometimes splash itupon those who are walking. My proposal, communicated to the gooddoctor, was as follows: "For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets ofLondon and Westminster, it is proposed that the several watchmen becontracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons, and the mudrak'd up at other times, each in the several streets and lanes of hisround; that they be furnish'd with brooms and other proper instrumentsfor these purposes, to be kept at their respective stands, ready tofurnish the poor people they may employ in the service. "That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps atproper distances, before the shops and windows of houses are usuallyopened, when the scavengers, with close-covered carts, shall alsocarry it all away. "That the mud, when rak'd up, be not left in heaps to be spread abroadagain by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses, but that thescavengers be provided with bodies of carts, not plac'd high uponwheels, but low upon sliders, with lattice bottoms, which, beingcover'd with straw, will retain the mud thrown into them, and permitthe water to drain from it, whereby it will become much lighter, watermaking the greatest part of its weight; these bodies of carts to beplac'd at convenient distances, and the mud brought to them inwheelbarrows; they remaining where plac'd till the mud is drain'd, andthen horses brought to draw them away." I have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part ofthis proposal, on account of the narrowness of some streets, and thedifficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as not to encumber toomuch the passage; but I am still of opinion that the former, requiringthe dust to be swept up and carry'd away before the shops are open, isvery practicable in the summer, when the days are long; for, inwalking thro' the Strand and Fleet-street one morning at seveno'clock, I observ'd there was not one shop open, tho' it had beendaylight and the sun up above three hours; the inhabitants of Londonchusing voluntarily to live much by candle-light, and sleep bysunshine, and yet often complain, a little absurdly, of the duty oncandles, and the high price of tallow. Some may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating;but when they consider that tho' dust blown into the eyes of a singleperson, or into a single shop on a windy day, is but of smallimportance, yet the great number of the instances in a populous city,and its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence, perhapsthey will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention toaffairs of this seemingly low nature. Human felicity is produced notso much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as bylittle advantages that occur every day. Thus, if you teach a pooryoung man to shave himself, and keep his razor in order, you maycontribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him athousand guineas. The money may be soon spent, the regret onlyremaining of having foolishly consumed it; but in the other case, heescapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers, and of theirsometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths, and dull razors; he shaveswhen most convenient to him, and enjoys daily the pleasure of itsbeing done with a good instrument. With these sentiments I havehazarded the few preceding pages, hoping they may afford hints whichsome time or other may be useful to a city I love, having lived manyyears in it very happily, and perhaps to some of our towns in America. Having been for some time employed by the postmaster-general ofAmerica as his comptroller in regulating several offices, and bringingthe officers to account, I was, upon his death in 1753, appointed,jointly with Mr. William Hunter, to succeed him, by a commission fromthe postmaster-general in England. The American office never hadhitherto paid anything to that of Britain. We were to have six hundredpounds a year between us, if we could make that sum out of the profitsof the office. To do this, a variety of improvements were necessary;some of these were inevitably at first expensive, so that in the firstfour years the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us.But it soon after began to repay us; and before I was displac'd by afreak of the ministers, of which I shall speak hereafter, we hadbrought it to yield _three times_ as much clear revenue to the crownas the post-office of Ireland. Since that imprudent transaction, theyhave receiv'd from it--not one farthing! The business of the post-office occasion'd my taking a journey thisyear to New England, where the College of Cambridge, of their ownmotion, presented me with the degree of Master of Arts. Yale College,in Connecticut, had before made me a similar compliment. Thus, withoutstudying in any college, I came to partake of their honours. They wereconferr'd in consideration of my improvements and discoveries in theelectric branch of natural philosophy. XIV ALBANY PLAN OF UNION In 1754, war with France being again apprehended, a congress ofcommissioners from the different colonies was, by an order of theLords of Trade, to be assembled at Albany, there to confer with thechiefs of the Six Nations concerning the means of defending both theircountry and ours. Governor Hamilton, having receiv'd this order,acquainted the House with it, requesting they would furnish properpresents for the Indians, to be given on this occasion; and naming thespeaker (Mr. Norris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr.Secretary Peters as commissioners to Pennsylvania. The Houseapprov'd the nomination, and provided the goods for the present, andtho' they did not much like treating out of the provinces; and we metthe other commissioners at Albany about the middle of June. In our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the union of allthe colonies under one government, so far as might be necessary fordefense, and other important general purposes. As we pass'd thro' NewYork, I had there shown my project to Mr. James Alexander and Mr.Kennedy, two gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs, and,being fortified by their approbation, I ventur'd to lay it before theCongress. It then appeared that several of the commissioners hadform'd plans of the same kind. A previous question was first taken,whether a union should be established, which pass'd in the affirmativeunanimously. A committee was then appointed, one member from eachcolony, to consider the several plans and report. Mine happen'd to bepreferr'd, and, with a few amendments, was accordingly reported. By this plan the general government was to be administered by apresident-general, appointed and supported by the crown, and a grandcouncil was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of theseveral colonies, met in their respective assemblies. The debates uponit in Congress went on daily, hand in hand with the Indian business.Many objections and difficulties were started, but at length they wereall overcome, and the plan was unanimously agreed to, and copiesordered to be transmitted to the Board of Trade and to the assembliesof the several provinces. Its fate was singular; the assemblies didnot adopt it, as they all thought there was too much _prerogative_ init, and in England it was judg'd to have too much of the _democratic_.The Board of Trade therefore did not approve of it, nor recommend itfor the approbation of his majesty; but another scheme was form'd,supposed to answer the same purpose better, whereby the governors ofthe provinces, with some members of their respective councils, were tomeet and order the raising of troops, building of forts, etc., and todraw on the treasury of Great Britain for the expense, which wasafterwards to be refunded by an Parliament laying a tax onAmerica. My plan, with my reasons in support of it, is to be foundamong my political papers that are printed. Being the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation withGovernor Shirley upon both the plans. Part of what passed between uson the occasion may also be seen among those papers. The different andcontrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it wasreally the true medium; and I am still of opinion it would have beenhappy for both sides the water if it had been adopted. The colonies,so united, would have been sufficiently strong to have defendedthemselves; there would then have been no need of troops from England;of course, the subsequent pretence for taxing America, and the bloodycontest it occasioned, would have been avoided. But such mistakes arenot new; history is full of the errors of states and princes. "Look round the habitable world, how few Know their own good, or, knowing it, pursue!" Those who govern, having much business on their hands, do notgenerally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying intoexecution new projects. The best public measures are therefore seldom_adopted from previous wisdom, but forc'd by the occasion_. The Governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the Assembly,expressed his approbation of the plan, "as appearing to him to bedrawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment, and thereforerecommended it as well worthy of their closest and most seriousattention." The House, however, by the management of a certain member,took it up when I happen'd to be absent, which I thought not veryfair, and reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all, tomy no small mortification. XV QUARRELS WITH THE PROPRIETARYGOVERNORS In my journey to Boston this year, I met at New York with our newgovernor, Mr. Morris, just arriv'd there from England, with whom I hadbeen before intimately acquainted. He brought a commission tosupersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tir'd with the disputes his proprietaryinstructions subjected him to, had resign'd. Mr. Morris ask'd me if Ithought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration. I said,"No; you may, on the contrary, have a very comfortable one, if youwill only take care not to enter into any dispute with the Assembly.""My dear friend," says he, pleasantly, "how can you advise my avoidingdisputes? You know I love disputing; it is one of my greatestpleasures; however, to show the regard I have for your counsel, Ipromise you I will, if possible, avoid them." He had some reason forloving to dispute, being eloquent, an acute sophister, and, therefore,generally successful in argumentative conversation. He had beenbrought up to it from a boy, his father, as I have heard, accustominghis children to dispute with one another for his diversion, whilesitting at table after dinner; but I think the practice was not wise;for, in the course of my observation, these disputing, contradicting,and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs. Theyget victory sometimes, but they never get good will, which would be ofmore use to them. We parted, he going to Philadelphia, and I toBoston. In returning, I met at New York with the votes of the Assembly, bywhich it appear'd that, notwithstanding his promise to me, he and theHouse were already in high contention; and it was a continual battlebetween them as long as he retain'd the government. I had my share ofit; for, as soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly, I was puton every committee for answering his speeches and messages, and by thecommittees always desired to make the drafts. Our answers, as well ashis messages, were often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive; and,as he knew I wrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined that,when we met, we could hardly avoid cutting throats; but he was sogood-natur'd a man that no personal difference between him and me wasoccasion'd by the contest, and we often din'd together. One afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in thestreet. "Franklin," says he, "you must go home with me and spend theevening; I am to have some company that you will like;" and, taking meby the arm, he led me to his house. In gay conversation over our wine,after supper, he told us, jokingly, that he much admir'd the idea ofSancho Panza, who, when it was proposed to give him a government,requested it might be a government of _blacks_, as then, if he couldnot agree with his people, he might sell them. One of his friends, whosat next to me, says, "Franklin, why do you continue to side withthese damn'd Quakers? Had not you better sell them? The proprietorwould give you a good price." "The governor," says I, "has not yet_blacked_ them enough." He, indeed, had laboured hard to blacken theAssembly in all his messages, but they wip'd off his colouring as fastas he laid it on, and plac'd it, in return, thick upon his own face;so that, finding he was likely to be negrofied himself, he, as well asMr. Hamilton, grew tir'd of the contest, and quitted the government. These public quarrels were all at bottom owing to theproprietaries, our hereditary governors, who, when any expense was tobe incurred for the defense of their province, with incrediblemeanness instructed their deputies to pass no levying thenecessary taxes, unless their vast estates were in the same actexpressly excused; and they had even taken bonds of these deputies toobserve such instructions. The Assemblies for three years held outagainst this injustice, tho' constrained to bend at last. At lengthCaptain Denny, who was Governor Morris's successor, ventured todisobey those instructions; how that was brought about I shall showhereafter. The "round, selfish, and self-important" squire of Don Quixote in Cervantes' romance of that name. My acts in Morris's time, military, etc.--_Marg. note_. But I am got forward too fast with my story: there are still sometransactions to be mention'd that happened during the administrationof Governor Morris. War being in a manner commenced with France, the government ofMassachusetts Bay projected an attack upon Crown Point, and sentMr. Quincy to Pennsylvania, and Mr. Pownall, afterward GovernorPownall, to New York, to solicit assistance. As I was in the Assembly,knew its temper, and was Mr. Quincy's countryman, he appli'd to me formy influence and assistance. I dictated his address to them, which waswell received. They voted an aid of ten thousand pounds, to be laidout in provisions. But the governor refusing his assent to their bill(which included this with other sums granted for the use of thecrown), unless a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estatefrom bearing any part of the tax that would be necessary, theAssembly, tho' very desirous of making their grant to New Englandeffectual, were at a loss how to accomplish it. Mr. Quincy laboredhard with the governor to obtain his assent, but he was obstinate. On Lake Champlain, ninety miles north of Albany. It was captured by the French in 1731, attacked by the English in 1755 and 1756, and abandoned by the French in 1759. It was finally captured from the English by the Americans in 1775. I then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor,by orders on the trustees of the Loan office, which, by law, theAssembly had the right of drawing. There was, indeed, little or nomoney at that time in the office, and therefore I propos'd that theorders should be payable in a year, and to bear an interest of fiveper cent. With these orders I suppos'd the provisions might easily bepurchas'd. The Assembly, with very little hesitation, adopted theproposal. The orders were immediately printed, and I was one of thecommittee directed to sign and dispose of them. The fund for payingthem was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in theprovince upon loan, together with the revenue arising from the excise,which being known to be more than sufficient, they obtain'd instantcredit, and were not only receiv'd in payment for the provisions, butmany money'd people, who had cash lying by them, vested it in thoseorders, which they found advantageous, as they bore interest whileupon hand, and might on any occasion be used as money; so that theywere eagerly all bought up, and in a few weeks none of them were to beseen. Thus this important affair was by my means completed. Mr. Quincyreturn'd thanks to the Assembly in a handsome memorial, went homehighly pleas'd with this success of his embassy, and ever after borefor me the most cordial and affectionate friendship. XVI BRADDOCK'S EXPEDITION The British government, not chusing to permit the union of thecolonies as propos'd at Albany, and to trust that union with theirdefense, lest they should thereby grow too military, and feel theirown strength, suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain'dof them, sent over General Braddock with two regiments of regularEnglish troops for that purpose. He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia,and thence march'd to Frederictown, in Maryland, where he halted forcarriages. Our Assembly apprehending, from some information, that hehad conceived violent prejudices against them, as averse to theservice, wish'd me to wait upon him, not as from them, but aspostmaster-general, under the guise of proposing to settle with himthe mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatchesbetween him and the governors of the several provinces, with whom hemust necessarily have continual correspondence, and of which theypropos'd to pay the expense. My son accompanied me on this journey. We found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently for thereturn of those he had sent thro' the back parts of Maryland andVirginia to collect waggons. I stayed with him several days, din'dwith him daily, and had full opportunity of removing all hisprejudices, by the information of what the Assembly had before hisarrival actually done, and were still willing to do, to facilitate hisoperations. When I was about to depart, the returns of waggons to beobtained were brought in, by which it appear'd that they amounted onlyto twenty-five, and not all of those were in serviceable condition.The general and all the officers were surpris'd, declar'd theexpedition was then at an end, being impossible, and exclaim'd againstthe ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute ofthe means of conveying their stores, baggage, etc., not less than onehundred and fifty waggons being necessary. I happen'd to say I thought it was pity they had not been landedrather in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost every farmer had hiswaggon. The general eagerly laid hold of my words, and said, "Thenyou, sir, who are a man of interest there, can probably procure themfor us; and I beg you will undertake it." I ask'd what terms were tobe offer'd the owners of the waggons, and I was desir'd to put onpaper the terms that appeared to me necessary. This I did, and theywere agreed to, and a commission and instructions accordingly prepar'dimmediately. What those terms were will appear in the advertisement Ipublish'd as soon as I arriv'd at Lancaster, which being, from thegreat and sudden effect it produc'd, a piece of some curiosity, Ishall insert it at length, as follows: "Advertisement. "Lancaster, _April_ 26, 1755. "Whereas, one hundred and fifty waggons, with four horses to eachwaggon, and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses, are wanted for theservice of his majesty's forces now about to rendezvous at Will'sCreek, and his excellency General Braddock having been pleased toempower me to contrthe hire of the same, I hereby give noticethat I shall attend for that purpose at Lancaster from this day tonext Wednesday evening, and at York from next Thursday morning tillFriday evening, where I shall be ready to agree for waggons and teams,or single horses, on the following terms, viz.: 1. That there shall bepaid for each waggon, with four good horses and a driver, fifteenshillings per diem; and for each able horse with a pack-saddle, orother saddle and furniture, two shillings per diem; and for each ablehorse without a saddle, eighteen pence per diem. 2. That the paycommence from the time of their joining the forces at Will's Creek,which must be on or before the 20th of May ensuing, and that areasonable allowance be paid over and above for the time necessary fortheir travelling to Will's Creek and home again after their discharge.3. Each waggon and team, and every saddle or pack horse, is to bevalued by indifferent persons chosen between me and the owner; and incase of the loss of any waggon, team, or other horse in the service,the price according to such valuation is to be allowed and paid. 4.Seven days' pay is to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the ownerof each waggon and team, or horse, at the time of contracting, ifrequired, and the remainder to be paid by General Braddock, or by thepaymaster of the army, at the time of their discharge, or from time totime, as it shall be demanded. 5. No drivers of waggons, or personstaking care of the hired horses, are on any account to be called uponto do the duty of soldiers, or be otherwise employed than inconducting or taking care of their carriages or horses. 6. All oats,Indian corn, or other forage that waggons or horses bring to the camp,more than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses, is to betaken for the use of the army, and a reasonable price paid for thesame. "Note.--My son, William Franklin, is empowered to enter into likecontracts with any person in Cumberland county. "B. Franklin." _"To the inhabitants of the Counties of Lancaster, York, and Cumberland._ "Friends and Countrymen, "Being occasionally at the camp at Frederic a few days since, Ifound the general and officers extremely exasperated on account oftheir not being supplied with horses and carriages, which had beenexpected from this province, as most able to furnish them; but,through the dissensions between our governor and Assembly, money hadnot been provided, nor any steps taken for that purpose. By chance. "It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into thesecounties, to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as shouldbe wanted, and compel as many persons into the service as would benecessary to drive and take care of them. "I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through thesecounties on such an occasion, especially considering the temper theyare in, and their resentment against us, would be attended with manyand great inconveniences to the inhabitants, and therefore morewillingly took the trouble of trying first what might be done by fairand equitable means. The people of these back counties have latelycomplained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting; youhave an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a veryconsiderable sum; for, if the service of this expedition shouldcontinue, as it is more than probable it will, for one hundred andtwenty days, the hire of these waggons and horses will amount toupward of thirty thousand pounds, which will be paid you in silver andgold of the king's money. "The service will be light and easy, for the army will scarce marchabove twelve miles per day, and the waggons and baggage-horses, asthey carry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfareof the army, must march with the army, and no faster; and are, for thearmy's sake, always placed where they can be most secure, whether in amarch or in a camp. "If you are really, as I believe you are, good and loyal subjects tohis majesty, you may now do a most acceptable service, and make iteasy to yourselves; for three or four of such as cannot separatelyspare from the business of their plantations a waggon and four horsesand a driver, may do it together, one furnishing the waggon, anotherone or two horses, and another the driver, and divide the payproportionately between you; but if you do not this service to yourking and country voluntarily, when such good pay and reasonable termsare offered to you, your loyalty will be strongly suspected. Theking's business must be done; so many brave troops, come so far foryour defense, must not stand idle through your backwardness to do whatmay be reasonably expected from you; waggons and horses must be had;violent measures will probably be used, and you will be left to seekfor a recompense where you can find it, and your case, perhaps, belittle pitied or regarded. "I have no particular interest in this affair, as, except thesatisfaction of endeavouring to do good, I shall have only my labourfor my pains. If this method of obtaining the waggons and horses isnot likely to succeed, I am obliged to send word to the general infourteen days; and I suppose Sir John St. Clair, the hussar, with abody of soldiers, will immediately enter the province for the purpose,which I shall be sorry to hear, because I am very sincerely and trulyyour friend and well-wisher, "B. Franklin." I received of the general about eight hundred pounds, to be disbursedin advance-money to the waggon owners, etc.; but that sum beinginsufficient, I advanc'd upward of two hundred pounds more, and in twoweeks the one hundred and fifty waggons, with two hundred andfifty-nine carrying horses, were on their march for the camp. Theadvertisement promised payment according to the valuation, in case anywaggon or horse should be lost. The owners, however, alleging they didnot know General Braddock, or what dependence might be had on hispromise, insisted on my bond for the performance, which I accordinglygave them. While I was at the camp, supping one evening with the officers ofColonel Dunbar's regiment, he represented to me his concern for thesubalterns, who, he said, were generally not in affluence, and couldill afford, in this dear country, to lay in the stores that might benecessary in so long a march, thro' a wilderness, where nothing was tobe purchas'd. I commiserated their case, and resolved to endeavourprocuring them some relief. I said nothing, however, to him of myintention, but wrote the next morning to the committee of theAssembly, who had the disposition of some public money, warmlyrecommending the case of these officers to their consideration, andproposing that a present should be sent them of necessaries andrefreshments. My son, who had some experience of a camp life, and ofits wants, drew up a list for me, which I enclos'd in my letter. Thecommittee approv'd, and used such diligence that, conducted by my son,the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons. They consistedof twenty parcels, each containing 6 lbs. loaf sugar.6 lbs. good Muscovado do.1 lb. good green tea.1 lb. good bohea do.6 lbs. good ground coffee.6 lbs. chocolate.1-2 cwt. best white biscuit.1-2 lb. pepper.1 quart best white winevinegar.1 Gloucester cheese.1 kegg containing 20 lbs.good butter.2 doz. old Madeira wine.2 gallons Jamaica spirits.1 bottle flour of mustard.2 well-cur'd hams.1-2 dozen dry'd tongues.6 lbs. rice.6 lbs. raisins. These twenty parcels, well pack'd, were placed on as many horses, eachparcel, with the horse, being intended as a present for one officer.They were very thankfully receiv'd, and the kindness acknowledg'd byletters to me from the colonels of both regiments, in the mostgrateful terms. The general, too, was highly satisfied with my conductin procuring him the waggons, etc., and readily paid my account ofdisbursements, thanking me repeatedly, and requesting my fartherassistance in sending provisions after him. I undertook this also, andwas busily employ'd in it till we heard of his defeat, advancing forthe service of my own money, upwards of one thousand pounds sterling,of which I sent him an account. It came to his hands, luckily for me,a few days before the battle, and he return'd me immediately an orderon the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds, leaving theremainder to the next account. I consider this payment as good luck,having never been able to obtain that remainder, of which morehereafter. This general was, I think, a brave man, and might probably have made afigure as a good officer in some European war. But he had too muchself-confidence, too high an opinion of the validity of regulartroops, and too mean a one of both Americans and Indians. GeorgeCroghan, our Indian interpreter, join'd him on his march with onehundred of those people, who might have been of great use to his armyas guides, scouts, etc., if he had treated them kindly; but heslighted and neglected them, and they gradually left him. In conversation with him one day, he was giving me some account of hisintended progress. "After taking Fort Duquesne," says he, "I am toproceed to Niagara; and, having taken that, to Frontenac, if theseason will allow time; and I suppose it will, for Duquesne can hardlydetain me above three or four days; and then I see nothing that canobstruct my march to Niagara." Having before revolv'd in my mind thelong line his army must make in their march by a very narrow road, tobe cut for them thro' the woods and bushes, and also what I had readof a former defeat of fifteen hundred French, who invaded the Iroquoiscountry, I had conceiv'd some doubts and some fears for the event ofthe campaign. But I ventur'd only to say, "To be sure, sir, if youarrive well before Duquesne, with these fine troops, so well providedwith artillery, that place not yet completely fortified, and as wehear with no very strong garrison, can probably make but a shortresistance. The only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your marchis from ambuscades of Indians, who, by constant practice, aredexterous in laying and executing them; and the slender line, nearfour miles long, which your army must make, may expose it to beattack'd by surprise in its flanks, and to be cut like a thread intoseveral pieces, which, from their distance, cannot come up in time tosupport each other." Pittsburg. Kingston, at the eastern end of Lake Ontario. He smil'd at my ignorance, and reply'd, "These savages may, indeed, bea formidable enemy to your raw American militia, but upon the king'sregular and disciplin'd troops, sir, it is impossible they should makeany impression." I was conscious of an impropriety in my disputingwith a military man in matters of his profession, and said no more.The enemy, however, did not take the advantage of his army which Iapprehended its long line of march expos'd it to, but let it advancewithout interruption till within nine miles of the place; and then,when more in a body (for it had just passed a river, where the fronthad halted till all were come over), and in a more open part of thewoods than any it had pass'd, attack'd its advanced guard by heavyfire from behind trees and bushes, which was the first intelligencethe general had of an enemy's being near him. This guard beingdisordered, the general hurried the troops up to their assistance,which was done in great confusion, thro' waggons, baggage, and cattle;and presently the fire came upon their flank: the officers, being onhorseback, were more easily distinguish'd, pick'd out as marks, andfell very fast; and the soldiers were crowded together in a huddle,having or hearing no orders, and standing to be shot at tilltwo-thirds of them were killed; and then, being seiz'd with a panick,the whole fled with precipitation. The waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamper'd; theirexample was immediately followed by others; so that all the waggons,provisions, artillery, and stores were left to the enemy. The general,being wounded, was brought off with difficulty; his secretary, Mr.Shirley, was killed by his side; and out of eighty-six officers,sixty-three were killed or wounded, and seven hundred and fourteen menkilled out of eleven hundred. These eleven hundred had been picked menfrom the whole army; the rest had been left behind with ColonelDunbar, who was to follow with the heavier part of the stores,provisions, and baggage. The flyers, not being pursu'd, arriv'd atDunbar's camp, and the panick they brought with them instantly seiz'dhim and all his people; and, tho' he had now above one thousand men,and the enemy who had beaten Braddock did not at most exceed fourhundred Indians and French together, instead of proceeding, andendeavouring to recover some of the lost honour, he ordered all thestores, ammunition, etc., to be destroy'd, that he might have morehorses to assist his flight towards the settlements, and less lumberto remove. He was there met with requests from the governors ofVirginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, that he would post his troops onthe frontier, so as to afford some protection to the inhabitants; buthe continued his hasty march thro' all the country, not thinkinghimself safe till he arrived at Philadelphia, where the inhabitantscould protect him. This whole transaction gave us Americans the firstsuspicion that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regularshad not been well founded. Other accounts of this expedition and defeat may be found in Fiske's _Washington and his Country_, or Lodge's _George Washington_, Vol. 1. In their first march, too, from their landing till they got beyond thesettlements, they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants, totallyruining some poor families, besides insulting, abusing, and confiningthe people if they remonstrated. This was enough to put us out ofconceit of such defenders, if we had really wanted any. How differentwas the conduct of our French friends in 1781, who, during a marchthro' the most inhabited part of our country from Rhode Island toVirginia, near seven hundred miles, occasioned not the smallestcomplaint for the loss of a pig, a chicken, or even an apple. Captain Orme, who was one of the general's aids-de-camp, and, beinggrievously wounded, was brought off with him, and continu'd with himto his death, which happen'd in a few days, told me that he wastotally silent all the first day, and at night only said, "_Who wouldhave thought it?_" That he was silent again the following day, sayingonly at last, "_We shall better know how to deal with them anothertime_"; and dy'd in a few minutes after. The secretary's papers, with all the general's orders, instructions,and correspondence, falling into the enemy's hands, they selected andtranslated into French a number of the articles, which they printed,to prove the hostile intentions of the British court before thedeclaration of war. Among these I saw some letters of the general tothe ministry, speaking highly of the great service I had rendered thearmy, and recommending me to their notice. David Hume, too, who wassome years after secretary to Lord Hertford, when minister in France,and afterward to General Conway, when secretary of state, told me hehad seen among the papers in that office, letters from Braddock highlyrecommending me. But, the expedition having been unfortunate, myservice, it seems, was not thought of much value, for thoserecommendations were never of any use to me. A famous Scotch philosopher and historian (1711-1776). As to rewards from himself, I ask'd only one, which was, that he wouldgive orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our boughtservants, and that he would discharge such as had been alreadyenlisted. This he readily granted, and several were accordinglyreturn'd to their masters, on my application. Dunbar, when the commanddevolv'd on him, was not so generous. He being at Philadelphia, on hisretreat, or rather flight, I apply'd to him for the discharge of theservants of three poor farmers of Lancaster county that he hadenlisted, reminding him of the late general's orders on that head. Hepromised me that, if the masters would come to him at Trenton, wherehe should be in a few days on his march to New York, he would theredeliver their men to them. They accordingly were at the expense andtrouble of going to Trenton, and there he refus'd to perform hispromise, to their great loss and disappointment. As soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known, allthe owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bond topay. Their demands gave me a great deal of trouble, my acquaintingthem that the money was ready in the paymaster's hands, but thatorders for paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley,and my assuring them that I had apply'd to that general by letter;but, he being at a distance, an answer could not soon be receiv'd, andthey must have patience, all this was not sufficient to satisfy, andsome began to sue me. General Shirley at length relieved me from thisterrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims,and ordering payment. They amounted to near twenty thousand pound,which to pay would have ruined me. Governor of Massachusetts and commander of the British forces in America. Before we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors Bond came to mewith a subscription paper for raising money to defray the expense of agrand firework, which it was intended to exhibit at a rejoicing onreceipt of the news of our taking Fort Duquesne. I looked grave, andsaid it would, I thought, be time enough to prepare for the rejoicingwhen we knew we should have occasion to rejoice. They seem'd surpris'dthat I did not immediately comply with their proposal. "Why thed----l!" says one of them, "you surely don't suppose that thefort will not be taken?" "I don't know that it will not be taken, butI know that the events of war are subject to great uncertainty." Igave them the reasons of my doubting; the subscription was dropt, andthe projectors thereby missed the mortification they would haveundergone if the firework had been prepared. Dr. Bond, on some otheroccasion afterward, said that he did not like Franklin's forebodings. Governor Morris, who had continually worried the Assembly with messageafter message before the defeat of Braddock, to beat them into themaking of acts to raise money for the defense of the province, withouttaxing, among others, the proprietary estates, and had rejected alltheir bills for not having such an exempting clause, now redoubled hisattacks with more hope of success, the danger and necessity beinggreater. The Assembly, however, continu'd firm, believing they hadjustice on their side, and that it would be giving up an essentialright if they suffered the governor to amend their money-bills. In oneof the last, indeed, which was for granting fifty thousand pounds, hispropos'd amendment was only of a single word. The bill express'd "thatall estates, real and personal, were to be taxed, those of theproprietaries _not_ excepted." His amendment was, for _not_ read_only_: a small, but very material alteration. However, when the newsof this disaster reached England, our friends there whom we had takencare to furnish with all the Assembly's answers to the governor'smessages, rais'd a clamor against the proprietaries for their meannessand injustice in giving their governor such instructions; some goingso far as to say that, by obstructing the defense of their province,they forfeited their right to it. They were intimidated by this, andsent orders to their receiver-general to add five thousand pounds oftheir money to whatever sum might be given by the Assembly for suchpurpose. This, being notified to the House, was accepted in lieu of their shareof a general tax, and a new bill was form'd, with an exempting clause,which passed accordingly. By this was appointed one of thecommissioners for disposing of the money, sixty thousand pounds. I hadbeen active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage, and had,at the same time, drawn a bill for establishing and disciplining avoluntary militia, which I carried thro' the House without muchdifficulty, as care was taken in it to leave the Quakers at theirliberty. To promote the association necessary to form the militia, Iwrote a dialogue, stating and answering all the objections I couldthink of to such a militia, which was printed, and had, as I thought,great effect. This dialogue and the militia in the Gentleman's Magazine for February and March, 1756.--_Marg. note._ XVII FRANKLIN'S DEFENSE OF THEFRONTIER While the several companies in the city and country were forming, andlearning their exercise, the governor prevail'd with me to take chargeof our North-western frontier, which was infested by the enemy, andprovide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops andbuilding a line of forts. I undertook this military business, tho' Idid not conceive myself well qualified for it. He gave me a commissionwith full powers, and a parcel of blank commissions for officers, tobe given to whom I thought fit. I had but little difficulty in raisingmen, having soon five hundred and sixty under my command. My son, whohad in the preceding war been an officer in the army rais'd againstCanada, was my aid-de-camp, and of great use to me. The Indians hadburned Gnadenhut, a village settled by the Moravians, and massacredthe inhabitants; but the place was thought a good situation for one ofthe forts. Pronounced Gna´-den-hoot. In order to march thither, I assembled the companies at Bethlehem, thechief establishment of those people. I was surprised to find it in sogood a posture of defense; the destruction of Gnadenhut had made themapprehend danger. The principal buildings were defended by a stockade;they had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from New York,and had even plac'd quantities of small paving stones between thewindows of their high stone houses, for their women to throw down uponthe heads of any Indians that should attempt to force into them. Thearmed brethren, too, kept watch, and reliev'd as methodically as inany garrison town. In conversation with the bishop, Spangenberg, Imention'd this my surprise; for, knowing they had obtained an exempting them from military duties in the colonies, I hadsuppos'd they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms. Heanswer'd me that it was not one of their established principles, butthat, at the time of their obtaining that act, it was thought to be aprinciple with many of their people. On this occasion, however, they,to their surprise, found it adopted by but a few. It seems they wereeither deceiv'd in themselves, or deceiv'd the Parliament; but commonsense, aided by present danger, will sometimes be too strong forwhimsical opinions. It was the beginning of January when we set out upon this business ofbuilding forts. I sent one detachment toward the Minisink, withinstructions to erect one for the security of that upper part of thecountry, and another to the lower part, with similar instructions; andI concluded to go myself with the rest of my force to Gnadenhut, wherea fort was tho't more immediately necessary. The Moravians procur'd mefive waggons for our tools, stores, baggage, etc. Just before we left Bethlehem, eleven farmers, who had been drivenfrom their plantations by the Indians, came to me requesting a supplyof firearms, that they might go back and fetch off their cattle. Igave them each a gun with suitable ammunition. We had not march'd manymiles before it began to rain, and it continued raining all day; therewere no habitations on the road to shelter us, till we arriv'd nearnight at the house of a German, where, and in his barn, we were allhuddled together, as wet as water could make us. It was well we werenot attack'd in our march, for our arms were of the most ordinarysort, and our men could not keep their gun locks dry. The Indiansare dexterous in contrivances for that purpose, which we had not. Theymet that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned, and killed tenof them. The one who escap'd inform'd that his and his companions'guns would not go off, the priming being wet with the rain. Flint-lock guns, discharged by means of a spark struck from flint and steel into powder (priming) in an open pan. The next day being fair, we continu'd our march, and arriv'd at thedesolated Gnadenhut. There was a saw-mill near, round which were leftseveral piles of boards, with which we soon hutted ourselves; anoperation the more necessary at that inclement season, as we had notents. Our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we foundthere, who had been half interr'd by the country people. The next morning our fort was plann'd and mark'd out, thecircumference measuring four hundred and fifty-five feet, which wouldrequire as many palisades to be made of trees, one with another, of afoot diameter each. Our axes, of which we had seventy, wereimmediately set to work to cut down trees, and, our men beingdexterous in the use of them, great despatch was made. Seeing thetrees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to look at my watch when twomen began to cut at a pine; in six minutes they had it upon theground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter. Each pine madethree palisades of eighteen feet long, pointed at one end. While thesewere preparing, our other men dug a trench all round, of three feetdeep, in which the palisades were to be planted; and, our waggons, thebodies being taken off, and the fore and hind wheels separatedby taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch, wehad ten carriages, with two horses each, to bring the palisades fromthe woods to the spot. When they were set up, our carpenters built astage of boards all round within, about six feet high, for the men to standon when to fire thro' the loopholes. We had one swivel gun, which wemounted on one of the angles, and fir'd it as soon as fix'd, to letthe Indians know, if any were within hearing, that we had such pieces;and thus our fort, if such a magnificent name may be given to somiserable a stockade, was finish'd in a week, though it rain'd so hardevery other day that the men could not work. Here the pole connecting the front and rear wheels of a wagon. This gave me occasion to observe, that, when men are employ'd, theyare best content'd; for on the days they worked they were good-natur'dand cheerful, and, with the consciousness of having done a good day'swork, they spent the evening jollily; but on our idle days they weremutinous and quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork, the bread,etc., and in continual ill-humour, which put me in mind of asea-captain, whose rule it was to keep his men constantly at work;and, when his mate once told him that they had done everything, andthere was nothing further to employ them about, _"Oh," says he, "makethem scour the anchor."_ This kind of fort, however contemptible, is a sufficient defenseagainst Indians, who have no cannon. Finding ourselves now postedsecurely, and having a place to retreat to on occasion, we ventur'dout in parties to scour the adjacent country. We met with no Indians,but we found the places on the neighbouring hills where they had lainto watch our proceedings. There was an art in their contrivance ofthose places that seems worth mention. It being winter, a fire wasnecessary for them; but a common fire on the surface of the groundwould by its light have discover'd their position at a distance. Theyhad therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter, andsomewhat deeper; we saw where they had with their hatchets cut off thecharcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods. With thesecoals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes, and weobserv'd among the weeds and grass the prints of their bodies, made bytheir laying all round, with their legs hanging down in the holes tokeep their feet warm, which, with them, is an essential point. Thiskind of fire, so manag'd, could not discover them, either by itslight, flame, sparks, or even smoke: it appear'd that their number wasnot great, and it seems they saw we were too many to be attacked bythem with prospect of advantage. We had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister, Mr. Beatty,who complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayersand exhortations. When they enlisted, they were promised, besides payand provisions, a gill of rum a day, which was punctually serv'd outto them, half in the morning, and the other half in the evening; and Iobserved they were as punctual in attending to receive it; upon whichI said to Mr. Beatty, "It is, perhaps, below the dignity of yourprofession to steward of the rum, but if you were to deal itout and only just after prayers, you would have them all about you."He liked the tho't, undertook the office, and, with the help of a fewhands to measure out the liquor, executed it to satisfaction, andnever were prayers more generally and more punctually attended; sothat I thought this method preferable to the punishment inflicted bysome military laws for non-attendance on divine service. I had hardly finish'd this business, and got my fort well stor'd withprovisions, when I receiv'd a letter from the governor, acquainting methat he had call'd the Assembly, and wished my attendance there, ifthe posture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remainingthere was no longer necessary. My friends, too, of the Assembly,pressing me by their letters to be, if possible, at the meeting, andmy three intended forts being now compleated, and the inhabitantscontented to remain on their farms under that protection, I resolvedto return; the more willingly, as a New England officer, ColonelClapham, experienced in Indian war, being on a visit to ourestablishment, consented to accept the command. I gave him acommission, and, parading the garrison, had it read before them, andintroduc'd him to them as an officer who, from his skill in militaryaffairs, was much more fit to command them than myself; and, givingthem a little exhortation, took my leave. I was escorted as far asBethlehem, where I rested a few days to recover from the fatigue I hadundergone. The first night, being in a good bed, I could hardly sleep,it was so different from my hard lodging on the floor of our hut atGnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two. While at Bethlehem, I inquir'd a little into the practice of theMoravians: some of them had accompanied me, and all were very kind tome. I found they work'd for a common stock, ate at common tables, andslept in common dormitories, great numbers together. In thedormitories I observed loopholes, at certain distances all along justunder the ceiling, which I thought judiciously placed for change ofair. I was at their church, where I was entertain'd with good musick,the organ being accompanied with violins, hautboys, flutes, clarinets,etc. I understood that their sermons were not usually preached tomixed congregations of men, women, and children, as is our commonpractice, but that they assembled sometimes the married men, at othertimes their wives, then the young men, the young women, and the littlechildren, each division by itself. The sermon I heard was to thelatter, who came in and were plac'd in rows on benches; the boys underthe conduct of a young man, their tutor, and the girls conducted by ayoung woman. The discourse seem'd well adapted to their capacities,and was delivered in a pleasing, familiar manner, coaxing them, as itwere, to be good. They behav'd very orderly, but looked pale andunhealthy, which made me suspect they were kept too much within doors,or not allow'd sufficient exercise. I inquir'd concerning the Moravian marriages, whether the report wastrue that they were by lot. I was told that lots were us'd only inparticular cases; that generally, when a young man found himselfdispos'd to marry, he inform'd the elders of his class, who consultedthe elder ladies that govern'd the young women. As these elders of thedifferent sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositionsof their respective pupils, they could best judge what matches weresuitable, and their judgments were generally acquiesc'd in; but if,for example, it should happen that two or three young women were foundto be equally proper for the young man, the lot was then recurred to.I objected, if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of theparties, some of them may chance to be very unhappy. "And so theymay," answer'd my informer, "if you let the parties chuse forthemselves;" which, indeed, I could not deny. Being returned to Philadelphia, I found the association went onswimmingly, the inhabitants that were not Quakers having prettygenerally come into it, formed themselves into companies, and chosetheir captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, according to the new law.Dr. B. visited me, and gave me an account of the pains he had taken tospread a general good liking to the law, and ascribed much to thoseendeavours. I had had the vanity to ascribe all to my _Dialogue_;however, not knowing but that he might be in the right, I let himenjoy his opinion, which I take to be generally the best way in suchcases. The officers, meeting, chose me to be colonel of the regiment,which I this time accepted. I forget how many companies we had, but weparaded about twelve hundred well-looking men, with a company ofartillery, who had been furnished with six brass field-pieces, whichthey had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve times in aminute. The first time I reviewed my regiment they accompanied me tomy house, and would salute me with some rounds fired before my door,which shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus.And my new honour proved not much less brittle; for all ourcommissions were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in England. During this short time of my colonelship, being about to set out on ajourney to Virginia, the officers of my regiment took it into theirheads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town, asfar as the Lower Ferry. Just as I was getting on horseback they cameto my door, between thirty and forty, mounted, and all in theiruniforms. I had not been previously acquainted with the project, or Ishould have prevented it, being naturally averse to the assuming ofstate on any occasion; and I was a good deal chagrin'd at theirappearance, as I could not avoid their accompanying me. What made itworse was, that, as soon as we began to move, they drew their swordsand rode with them naked all the way. Somebody wrote an account ofthis to the proprietor, and it gave him great offense. No such honourhad been paid him when in the province, nor to any of his governors;and he said it was only proper to princes of the blood royal, whichmay be true for aught I know, who was, and still am, ignorant of theetiquette in such cases. This silly affair, however, greatly increased his rancour against me,which was before not a little, on account of my conduct in theAssembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation, which Ihad always oppos'd very warmly, and not without severe reflections onhis meanness and injustice of contending for it. He accused me to theministry as being the great obstacle to the King's service,preventing, by my influence in the House, the proper form of the billsfor raising money, and he instanced this parade with my officers as aproof of my having an intention to take the government of the provinceout of his hands by force. He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener,the postmaster-general, to deprive me of my office; but it had noother effect than to procure from Sir Everard a gentle admonition. Notwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and theHouse, in which I, as a member, had so large a share, there stillsubsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman and myself, andwe never had any personal difference. I have sometimes since thoughtthat his little or no resentment against me, for the answers it wasknown I drew up to his messages, might be the effect of professionalhabit, and that, being bred a lawyer, he might consider us both asmerely advocates for contending clients in a suit, he for theproprietaries and I for the Assembly. He would, therefore, sometimescall in a friendly way to advise with me on difficult points, andsometimes, tho' not often, take my advice. We acted in concert to supply Braddock's army with provisions; and,when the shocking news arrived of his defeat, the governor sent inhaste for me, to consult with him on measures for preventing thedesertion of the back counties. I forget now the advice I gave; but Ithink it was, that Dunbar should be written to, and prevail'd with, ifpossible, to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection,till, by reinforcements from the colonies, he might be able to proceedon the expedition. And, after my return from the frontier, he wouldhave had me undertake the conduct of such an expedition withprovincial troops, for the reduction of Fort Duquesne, Dunbar and hismen being otherwise employed; and he proposed to commission me asgeneral. I had not so good an opinion of my military abilities as heprofess'd to have, and I believe his professions must have exceededhis real sentiments; but probably he might think that my popularitywould facilitate the raising of the men, and my influence in Assembly,the grant of money to pay them, and that, perhaps, without taxing theproprietary estate. Finding me not so forward to engage as heexpected, the project was dropt, and he soon after left thegovernment, being superseded by Captain Denny. XVIII SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS Before I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs underthis new governor's administration, it may not be amiss here to givesome account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation. In 1746, being at Boston, I met there with a Dr. Spence, who waslately arrived from Scotland, and show'd me some electric experiments.They were imperfectly perform'd, as he was not very expert; but, beingon a subject quite new to me, they equally surpris'd and pleased me.Soon after my return to Philadelphia, our library company receiv'dfrom Mr. P. Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society of London, apresent of a glass tube, with some account of the use of it in makingsuch experiments. I eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what Ihad seen at Boston; and, by much practice, acquired great readiness inperforming those, also, which we had an account of from England,adding a number of new ones. I say much practice, for my house wascontinually full, for some time, with people who came to see these newwonders. The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge was founded in 1660 and holds the foremost place among English societies for the advancement of science. To divide a little this incumbrance among my friends, I caused anumber of similar tubes to be blown at our glass-house, with whichthey furnish'd themselves, so that we had at length severalperformers. Among these, the principal was Mr. Kinnersley, aningenious neighbour, who, being out of business, I encouraged toundertake showing the experiments for money, and drew up for him twolectures, in which the experiments were rang'd in such order, andaccompanied with such explanations in such method, as that theforegoing should assist in comprehending the following. He procur'd anelegant apparatus for the purpose, in which all the little machinesthat I had roughly made for myself were nicely form'd byinstrument-makers. His lectures were well attended, and gave greatsatisfaction; and after some time he went thro' the colonies,exhibiting them in every capital town, and pick'd up some money. Inthe West India islands, indeed, it was with difficulty the experimentscould be made, from the general moisture of the air. Oblig'd as we were to Mr. Collinson for his present of the tube, etc.,I thought it right he should be inform'd of our success in using it,and wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments.He got them read in the Royal Society, where they were not at firstthought worth so much notice as to be printed in their Transactions.One paper, which I wrote for Mr. Kinnersley, on the sameness oflightning with electricity, I sent to Dr. Mitchel, an acquaintanceof mine, and one of the members also of that society, who wrote meword that it had been read, but was laughed at by the connoisseurs.The papers, however, being shown to Dr. Fothergill, he thought them oftoo much value to be stifled, and advis'd the printing of them. Mr.Collinson then gave them to _Cave_ for publication in his Gentleman'sMagazine; but he chose to print them separately in a pamphlet, and Dr.Fothergill wrote the preface. Cave, it seems, judged rightly for hisprofit, for by the additions that arrived afterward, they swell'd to aquarto volume, which has had five editions, and cost him nothing forcopy-money. See page 327. It was, however, some time before those papers were much taken noticeof in England. A copy of them happening to fall into the hands of theCount de Buffon, a philosopher deservedly of great reputation inFrance, and, indeed, all over Europe, he prevailed with M. Dalibardto translate them into French, and they were printed at Paris. Thepublication offended the Abbé Nollet, preceptor in Natural Philosophyto the royal family, and an able experimenter, who had form'd andpublish'd a theory of electricity, which then had the general vogue.He could not at first believe that such a work came from America, andsaid it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decryhis system. Afterwards, having been assur'd that there really existedsuch a person as Franklin at Philadelphia, which he had doubted, hewrote and published a volume of Letters, chiefly address'd to me,defending his theory, and denying the verity of my experiments, and ofthe positions deduc'd from them. A celebrated French naturalist (1707-1788). Dalibard, who had translated Franklin's letters to Collinson into French, was the first to demonstrate, in a practical application of Franklin's experiment, that lightning and electricity are the same. "This was May 10th, 1752, one month before Franklin flew his famous kite at Philadelphia and proved the fI once purpos'd answering the abbé, and actually began the answer;but, on consideration that my writings contained a description ofexperiments which anyone might repeat and verify, and if not to beverifi'd, could not be defended; or of observations offer'd asconjectures, and not delivered dogmatically, therefore not laying meunder any obligation to defend them; and reflecting that a disputebetween two persons, writing in different languages, might belengthened greatly by mistranslations, and thence misconceptions ofone another's meaning, much of one of the abbé's letters being foundedon an error in the translation, I concluded to let my papers shift forthemselves, believing it was better to spend what time I could sparefrom public business in making new experiments, than in disputingabout those already made. I therefore never answered M. Nollet, andthe event gave me no cause to repent my silence; for my friend M. leRoy, of the Royal Academy of Sciences, took up my cause and refutedhim; my book was translated into the Italian, German, and Latinlanguages; and the doctrine it contain'd was by degrees universallyadopted by the philosophers of Europe, in preference to that of theabbé; so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect, exceptMonsieur B----, of Paris, his _élève_ and immediate disciple. What gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity, was thesuccess of one of its proposed experiments, made by Messrs. Dalibardand De Lor at Marly, for drawing lightning from the clouds. Thisengag'd the public attention everywhere. M. de Lor, who had anapparatus for experimental philosophy, and lectur'd in that branch ofscience, undertook to repeat what he called the _PhiladelphiaExperiments_; and, after they were performed before the king andcourt, all the curious of Paris flocked to see them. I will not swellthis narrative with an account of that capital experiment, nor of theinfinite pleasure I receiv'd in the success of a similar one I madesoon after with a kite at Philadelphia, as both are to be found in thehistories of electricity. Dr. Wright, an English physician, when at Paris, wrote to a friend,who was of the Royal Society, an account of the high esteem myexperiments were in among the learned abroad, and of their wonder thatmy writings had been so little noticed in England. The society, onthis, resum'd the consideration of the letters that had been read tothem; and the celebrated Dr. Watson drew up a summary account of them,and of all I had afterwards sent to England on the subject, which heaccompanied with some praise of the writer. This summary was thenprinted in their Transactions; and some members of the society inLondon, particularly the very ingenious Mr. Canton, having verifiedthe experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointedrod, and acquainting them with the success, they soon made me morethan amends for the slight with which they had before treated me.Without my having made any application for that honour, they chose mea member, and voted that I should be excus'd the customary payments,which would have amounted to twenty-five guineas; and ever since havegiven me their Transactions gratis. They also presented me with thegold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley for the year 1753, the delivery ofwhich was accompanied by a very handsome speech of the president, LordMacclesfield, wherein I was highly honoured. An English baronet (died in 1709), donator of a fund of £100, "in trust for the Royal Society of London for improving natural knowledge." XIX AGENT OF PENNSYLVANIA INLONDON Our new governor, Captain Denny, brought over for me thebefore mentioned medal from the Royal Society, which he presented tome at an entertainment given him by the city. He accompanied it withvery polite expressions of his esteem for me, having, as he said, beenlong acquainted with my character. After dinner, when the company, aswas customary at that time, were engag'd in drinking, he took me asideinto another room, and acquainted me that he had been advis'd by hisfriends in England to cultivate a friendship with me, as one who wascapable of giving him the best advice, and of contributing mosteffectually to the making his administration easy; that he thereforedesired of all things to have a good understanding with me, and hebegged me to be assured of his readiness on all occasions to render meevery service that might be in his power. He said much to me, also, ofthe proprietor's good disposition towards the province, and of theadvantage it might be to us all, and to me in particular, if theopposition that had been so long continu'd to his measures was dropt,and harmony restor'd between him and the people; in effecting which,it was thought no one could be more serviceable than myself; and Imight depend on adequate acknowledgments and recompenses, etc., etc.The drinkers, finding we did not return immediately to the table, sentus a decanter of Madeira, which the governor made liberal use of, andin proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and promises. My answers were to this purpose: that my circumstances, thanks to God,were such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me; and that,being a member of the Assembly, I could not possibly accept of any;that, however, I had no personal enmity to the proprietary, and that,whenever the public measures he propos'd should appear to be for thegood of the people, no one should espouse and forward them morezealously than myself; my past opposition having been founded on this,that the measures which had been urged were evidently intended toserve the proprietary interest, with great prejudice to that of thepeople; that I was much obliged to him (the governor) for hisprofessions of regard to me, and that he might rely on everything inmy power to make his administration as easy as possible, hoping at thesame time that he had not brought with him the same unfortunateinstruction his predecessor had been hampered with. On this he did not then explain himself; but when he afterwards cameto do business with the Assembly, they appear'd again, the disputeswere renewed, and I was as active as ever in the opposition, being thepenman, first, of the request to have a communication of theinstructions, and then of the remarks upon them, which may be found inthe votes of the time, and in the Historical Review I afterwardpublish'd. But between us personally no enmity arose; we were oftentogether; he was a man of letters, had seen much of the world, and wasvery entertaining and pleasing in conversation. He gave me the firstinformation that my old friend Jas. Ralph was still alive; that he wasesteem'd one of the best political writers in England; had beenemployed in the dispute between Prince Frederic and the king, andhad obtain'd a pension of three hundred a year; that his reputationwas indeed small as a poet, Pope having damned his poetry in the_Dunciad_, but his prose was thought as good as any man's. Quarrel between George II and his son, Frederick, Prince of Wales, who died before his father. A satirical poem by Alexander Pope directed against various contemporary writers. The Assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted inmanacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only withthe privileges of the people, but with the service of the crown,resolv'd to petition the king against them, and appointed me theiragent to go over to England, to present and support the petition. TheHouse had sent up a bill to the governor, granting a sum of sixtythousand pounds for the king's use (ten thousand pounds of which wassubjected to the orders of the then general, Lord Loudoun), which thegovernor absolutely refus'd to pass, in compliance with hisinstructions. I had agreed with Captain Morris, of the packet at New York, for mypassage, and my stores were put on board, when Lord Loudoun arriv'd atPhiladelphia, expressly, as he told me, to endeavour an accommodationbetween the governor and Assembly, that his majesty's service mightnot be obstructed by their dissensions. Accordingly, he desir'd thegovernor and myself to meet him, that he might hear what was to besaid on both sides. We met and discussed the business. In behalf ofthe Assembly, I urged all the various arguments that may be found inthe public papers of that time, which were of my writing, and areprinted with the minutes of the Assembly; and the governor pleaded hisinstructions, the bond he had given to observe them, and his ruin ifhe disobey'd, yet seemed not unwilling to hazard himself if LordLoudoun would advise it. This his lordship did not chuse to do, thoughI once thought I had nearly prevail'd with him to do it; but finallyhe rather chose to urge the compliance of the Assembly; and heentreated me to use my endeavours with them for that purpose,declaring that he would spare none of the king's troops for thedefense of our frontiers, and that, if we did not continue to providefor that defense ourselves, they must remain expos'd to the enemy. I acquainted the House with what had pass'd, and, presenting them witha set of resolutions I had drawn up, declaring our rights, and that wedid not relinquish our claim to those rights, but only suspended theexercise of them on this occasion thro' _force_, against which weprotested, they at length agreed to drop that bill, and frame anotherconformable to the proprietary instructions. This of course thegovernor pass'd, and I was then at liberty to proceed on my voyage.But, in the meantime, the packet had sailed with my sea-stores, whichwas some loss to me, and my only recompense was his lordship's thanksfor my service, all the credit of obtaining the accommodation fallingto his share. He set out for New York before me; and, as the time for dispatchingthe packet-boats was at his disposition, and there were two thenremaining there, one of which, he said, was to sail very soon, Irequested to know the precise time, that I might not miss her by anydelay of mine. His answer was, "I have given out that she is to sailon Saturday next; but I may let you know, _entre nous_, that if youare there by Monday morning, you will be in time, but do not delaylonger." By some accidental hindrance at a ferry, it was Monday noonbefore I arrived, and I was much afraid she might have sailed, as thewind was fair; but I was soon made easy by the information that shewas still in the harbor, and would not move till the next day. Onewould imagine that I was now on the very point of departing forEurope. I thought so; but I was not then so well acquainted with hislordship's character, of which _indecision_ was one of the strongestfeatures. I shall give some instances. It was about the beginning ofApril that I came to New York, and I think it was near the end of Junebefore we sail'd. There were then two of the packet-boats, which hadbeen long in port, but were detained for the general's letters, whichwere always to be ready to-morrow. Another packet arriv'd; she too wasdetain'd; and, before we sail'd, a fourth was expected. Ours was thefirst to be dispatch'd, as having been there longest. Passengers wereengaged in all, and some extremely impatient to be gone, and themerchants uneasy about their letters, and the orders they had givenfor insurance (it being war time) for fall goods; but their anxietyavail'd nothing; his lordship's letters were not ready; and yetwhoever waited on him found him always at his desk, pen in hand, andconcluded he must needs write abundantly. Going myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in hisantechamber one Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia, who had come fromthence express with a packet from Governor Denny for the general. Hedelivered to me some letters from my friends there, which occasion'dmy inquiring when he was to return, and where he lodg'd, that I mightsend some letters by him. He told me he was order'd to call to-morrowat nine for the general's answer to the governor, and should set offimmediately. I put my letters into his hands the same day. A fortnightafter I met him again in the same place. "So, you are soon return'd,Innis?" "_Return'd_! no, I am not _gone_ yet." "How so?" "I havecalled here by order every morning these two weeks past for hislordship's letter, and it is not yet ready." "Is it possible, when heis so great a writer? for I see him constantly at his escritoire.""Yes," says Innis, "but he is like St. George on the signs, _always onhorseback, and never rides on_." This observation of the messengerwas, it seems, well founded; for, when in England, I understood thatMr. Pitt gave it as one reason for removing this general, andsending Generals Amherst and Wolfe, _that the minister never heardfrom him, and could not know what he was doing_. William Pitt, first Earl of Chatham (1708-1778), a great English statesman and orator. Under his able administration, England won Canada from France. He was a friend of America at the time of our Revolution. This daily expectation of sailing, and all the three packets goingdown to Sandy Hook, to join the fleet there, the passengers thought itbest to be on board, lest by a sudden order the ships should sail, andthey be left behind. There, if I remember right, we were about sixweeks, consuming our sea-stores, and oblig'd to procure more. Atlength the fleet sail'd, the general and all his army on board, boundto Louisburg, with the intent to besiege and take that fortress; allthe packet-boats in company ordered to attend the general's ship,ready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready. We were outfive days before we got a letter with leave to part, and then our shipquitted the fleet and steered for England. The other two packets hestill detained, carried them with him to Halifax, where he stayed sometime to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts, then alteredhis mind as to besieging Louisburg, and returned to New York, with allhis troops, together with the two packets above mentioned, and alltheir passengers! During his absence the French and savages had takenFort George, on the frontier of that province, and the savages hadmassacred many of the garrison after capitulation. I saw afterwards in London Captain Bonnell, who commanded one of thosepackets. He told me that, when he had been detain'd a month, heacquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul, to a degree thatmust necessarily hinder her fast sailing, a point of consequence for apacket-boat, and requested an allowance of time to heave her down andclean her bottom. He was asked how long time that would require. Heanswered, three days. The general replied, "If you can do it in oneday, I give leave; otherwise not; for you must certainly sail the dayafter to-morrow." So he never obtain'd leave, though detainedafterwards from day to day during full three months. I saw also in London one of Bonnell's passengers, who was so enrag'dagainst his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so long at NewYork, and then carrying him to Halifax and back again, that he sworehe would sue him for damages. Whether he did or not, I never heard;but, as he represented the injury to his affairs, it was veryconsiderable. On the whole, I wonder'd much how such a man came to be intrustedwith so important a business as the conduct of a great army; but,having since seen more of the great world, and the means of obtaining,and motives for giving places, my wonder is diminished. GeneralShirley, on whom the command of the army devolved upon the death ofBraddock, would, in my opinion, if continued in place, have made amuch better campaign than that of Loudoun in 1757, which wasfrivolous, expensive, and disgraceful to our nation beyond conception;for, tho' Shirley was not a bred soldier, he was sensible andsagacious in himself, and attentive to good advice from others,capable of forming judicious plans, and quick and active in carryingthem into execution. Loudoun, instead of defending the colonies withhis great army, left them totally expos'd while he paraded idly atHalifax, by which means Fort George was lost, besides, he derang'd allour mercantile operations, and distress'd our trade, by a long embargoon the exportation of provisions, on pretence of keeping supplies frombeing obtain'd by the enemy, but in reality for beating down theirprice in favour of the contractors, in whose profits, it was said,perhaps from suspicion only, he had a share. And, when at length theembargo was taken off, by neglecting to send notice of it toCharlestown, the Carolina fleet was detain'd near three months longer,whereby their bottoms were so much damaged by the worm that a greatpart of them foundered in their passage home. This relation illustrates the corruption that characterized English public life in the eighteenth century. (See page 308). It was gradually overcome in the early part of the next century. Shirley was, I believe, sincerely glad of being relieved from soburdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a manunacquainted with military business. I was at the entertainment givenby the city of New York to Lord Loudoun, on his taking upon him thecommand. Shirley, tho' thereby superseded, was present also. There wasa great company of officers, citizens, and strangers, and, some chairshaving been borrowed in the neighborhood, there was one among themvery low, which fell to the lot of Mr. Shirley. Perceiving it as I satby him, I said, "They have given you, sir, too low a seat." "Nomatter," says he, "Mr. Franklin, I find _a low seat_ the easiest." While I was, as afore mention'd, detain'd at New York, I receiv'd allthe accounts of the provisions, etc., that I had furnish'd toBraddock, some of which accounts could not sooner be obtain'd from thedifferent persons I had employ'd to assist in the business. Ipresented them to Lord Loudoun, desiring to be paid the balance. Hecaus'd them to be regularly examined by the proper officer, who, aftercomparing every article with its voucher, certified them to be right;and the balance due for which his lordship promis'd to give me anorder on the paymaster. This was, however, put off from time to time;and tho' I call'd often for it by appointment, I did not get it. Atlength, just before my departure, he told me he had, on betterconsideration, concluded not to mix his accounts with those of hispredecessors. "And you," says he, "when in England, have only toexhibit your accounts at the treasury, and you will be paidimmediately." I mention'd, but without effect, the great and unexpected expense Ihad been put to by being detain'd so long at New York, as a reason formy desiring to be presently paid; and on my observing that it was notright I should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining themoney I had advanc'd, as I charged no commission for my service, "O,Sir," says he, "you must not think of persuading us that you are nogainer; we understand better those affairs, and know that every oneconcerned in supplying the army finds means, in the doing it, to fillhis own pockets." I assur'd him that was not my case, and that I hadnot pocketed a farthing; but he appear'd clearly not to believe me;and, indeed, I have since learnt that immense fortunes are often madein such employments. As to my balance, I am not paid it tothis day, of which more hereafter. Our captain of the paquet had boasted much, before we sailed, of theswiftness of his ship; unfortunately, when we came to sea, she provedthe dullest of ninety-six sail, to his no small mortification. Aftermany conjectures respecting the cause, when we were near another shipalmost as dull as ours, which, however, gain'd upon us, the captainordered all hands to come aft, and stand as near the ensign staff aspossible. We were, passengers included, about forty persons. While westood there, the ship mended her pace, and soon left her neighbour farbehind, which prov'd clearly what our captain suspected, that she wasloaded too much by the head. The casks of water, it seems, had beenall plac'd forward; these he therefore order'd to be mov'd furtheraft, on which the ship recover'd her character, and proved the bestsailer in the fleet. The captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots,which is accounted thirteen miles per hour. We had on board, as apassenger, Captain Kennedy, of the Navy, who contended that it wasimpossible, and that no ship ever sailed so fast, and that there musthave been some error in the division of the log-line, or some mistakein heaving the log. A wager ensu'd between the two captains, to bedecided when there should be sufficient wind. Kennedy thereuponexamin'd rigorously the log-line, and, being satisfi'd with that, hedetermin'd to throw the log himself. Accordingly some days after, whenthe wind blew very fair and fresh, and the captain of thepaquet, Lutwidge, said he believ'd she then went at the rate ofthirteen knots, Kennedy made the experiment, and own'd his wager lost. A piece of wood shaped and weighted so as to keep it stable when in the water. To this is attached a line knotted at regular distances. By these devices it is possible to tell the speed of a ship. The above fgive for the sake of the following observation. Ithas been remark'd, as an imperfection in the art of ship-building,that it can never be known, till she is tried, whether a new ship willor will not be a good sailer; for that the model of a good-sailingship has been exactly follow'd in a new one, which has prov'd, on thecontrary, remarkably dull. I apprehend that this may partly beoccasion'd by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modes oflading, rigging, and sailing of a ship; each has his system; and thesame vessel, laden by the judgment and orders of one captain, shallsail better or worse than when by the orders of another. Besides, itscarce ever happens that a ship is form'd, fitted for the sea, andsail'd by the same person. One man builds the hull, another rigs her,a third lades and sails her. No one of these has the advantage ofknowing all the ideas and experience of the others, and, therefore,cannot draw just conclusions from a combination of the whole. Even in the simple operation of sailing when at sea, I have oftenobserv'd different judgments in the officers who commanded thesuccessive watches, the wind being the same. One would have the sailstrimm'd sharper or flatter than another, so that they seem'd to haveno certain rule to govern by. Yet I think a set of experiments mightbe instituted; first, to determine the most proper form of the hullfor swift sailing; next, the best dimensions and properest place forthe masts; then the form and quantity of sails, and their position, asthe wind may be; and, lastly, the disposition of the lading. This isan age of experiments, and I think a set accurately made and combin'dwould be of great use. I am persuaded, therefore, that ere long someingenious philosopher will undertake it, to whom I wish success. We were several times chas'd in our passage, but out-sail'd everything, and in thirty days had soundings. We had a good observation,and the captain judg'd himself so near our port, Falmouth, that, if wemade a good run in the night, we might be off the mouth of that harborin the morning, and by running in the night might escape the notice ofthe enemy's privateers, who often cruis'd near the entrance of thechannel. Accordingly, all the sail was set that we could possiblymake, and the wind being very fresh and fair, we went right before it,and made great way. The captain, after his observation, shap'd hiscourse, as he thought, so as to pass wide of the Scilly Isles; but itseems there is sometimes a strong indraught setting up St. George'sChannel, which deceives seamen and caused the loss of Sir CloudesleyShovel's squadron. This indraught was probably the cause of whathappened to us. We had a watchman plac'd in the bow, to whom they often called, "_Lookwell out before there_," and he as often answered, "_Ay, ay_"; butperhaps had his eyes shut, and was half asleep at the time, theysometimes answering, as is said, mechanically; for he did not see alight just before us, which had been hid by the studding-sails fromthe man at the helm, and from the rest of the watch, but by anaccidental yaw of the ship was discover'd, and occasion'd a greatalarm, we being very near it, the light appearing to me as big as acartwheel. It was midnight, and our captain fast asleep; but CaptainKennedy, jumping upon deck, and seeing the danger, ordered the ship towear round, all sails standing; an operation dangerous to the masts,but it carried us clear, and we escaped shipwreck, for we were runningright upon the rocks on which the lighthouse was erected. Thisdeliverance impressed me strongly with the utility of lighthouses, andmade me resolve to encourage the building more of them in America if Ishould live to return there. In the morning it was found by the soundings, etc., that we were nearour port, but a thick fog hid the land from our sight. About nineo'clock the fog began to rise, and seem'd to be lifted up from thewater like the curtain at a play-house, discovering underneath, thetown of Falmouth, the vessels in its harbor, and the fields thatsurrounded it. This was a most pleasing spectacle to those who hadbeen so long without any other prospects than the uniform view of avacant ocean, and it gave us the more pleasure as we were now freefrom the anxieties which the state of war occasion'd. I set out immediately, with my son, for London, and we only stopt alittle by the way to view Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, and LordPembroke's house and gardens, with his very curious antiquities atWilton. We arrived in London the 27th of July, 1757. A celebrated prehistoric ruin, probably of a temple built by the early Britons, near Salisbury, England. It consists of inner and outer circles of enormous stones, some of which are connected by stone slabs. "Here terminates the _Autobiography_, as published by Wm. Temple Franklin and his successors. What follows was written in the last year of Dr. Franklin's life, and was never before printed in English."--Mr. Bigelow's note in his edition of 1868. As soon as I was settled in a lodging Mr. Charles had provided for me,I went to visit Dr. Fothergill, to whom I was strongly recommended,and whose counsel respecting my proceedings I was advis'd to obtain.He was against an immediate complaint to government, and thought theproprietaries should first be personally appli'd to, who mightpossibly be induc'd by the interposition and persuasion of someprivate friends, to accommodate matters amicably. I then waited on myold friend and correspondent, Mr. Peter Collinson, who told me thatJohn Hanbury, the great Virginia merchant, had requested to beinformed when I should arrive, that he might carry me to LordGranville's, who was then President of the Council and wished tosee me as soon as possible. I agreed to go with him the next morning.Accordingly Mr. Hanbury called for me and took me in his carriage tothat nobleman's, who receiv'd me with great civility; and after somequestions respecting the present state of affairs in America anddiscourse thereupon, he said to me: "You Americans have wrong ideas ofthe nature of your constitution; you contend that the king'sinstructions to his governors are not laws, and think yourselves atliberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion. But thoseinstructions are not like the pocket instructions given to a ministergoing abroad, for regulating his conduct in some trifling point ofceremony. They are first drawn up by judges learned in the laws; theyare then considered, debated, and perhaps amended in Council, afterwhich they are signed by the king. They are then, so far as theyrelate to you, the _law of the land_, for the king is the Legislatorof the Colonies," I told his lordship this was new doctrine to me.I had always understood from our charters that our laws were to bemade by our Assemblies, to be presented indeed to the king for hisroyal assent, but that being once given the king could not repeal oralter them. And as the Assemblies could not make permanent lawswithout his assent, so neither could he make a law for them withouttheirs. He assur'd me I was totally mistaken. I did not think so,however, and his lordship's conversation having a little alarm'd me asto what might be the sentiments of the court concerning us, I wrote itdown as soon as I return'd to my lodgings. I recollected that about 20years before, a clause in a bill brought into Parliament by theministry had propos'd to make the king's instructions laws in thecolonies, but the clause was thrown out by the Commons, for which weadored them as our friends and friends of liberty, till by theirconduct towards us in 1765 it seem'd that they had refus'd that pointof sovereignty to the king only that they might reserve it forthemselves. George Granville or Grenville (1712-1770). As English premier from 1763 to 1765, he introduced the direct taxation of the American Colonies and has sometimes been called the immediate cause of the Revolution. This whole passage shows how hopelessly divergent were the English and American views on the relations between the mother country and her colonies. Grenville here made clear that the Americans were to have no voice in making or amending their laws. Parliament and the king were to have absolute power over the colonies. No wonder Franklin was alarmed by this new doctrine. With his keen insight into human nature and his consequent knowledge of American character, he foresaw the inevitable result of such an attitude on the part of England. This conversation with Grenville makes these last pages of the _Autobiography_ one of its most important parts. After some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries,they agreed to a meeting with me at Mr. T. Penn's house in SpringGarden. The conversation at first consisted of mutual declarations ofdisposition to reasonable accommodations, but I suppose each party hadits own ideas of what should be meant by _reasonable_. We then wentinto consideration of our several points of complaint, which Ienumerated. The proprietaries justify'd their conduct as well as theycould, and I the Assembly's. We now appeared very wide, and so farfrom each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope ofagreement. However, it was concluded that I should give them the headsof our complaints in writing, and they promis'd then to consider them.I did so soon after, but they put the paper into the hands of theirsolicitor, Ferdinand John Paris, who managed for them all their lawbusiness in their great suit with the neighbouring proprietary ofMaryland, Lord Baltimore, which had subsisted 70 years, and wrote forthem all their papers and messages in their dispute with the Assembly.He was a proud, angry man, and as I had occasionally in the answers ofthe Assembly treated his papers with some severity, they being reallyweak in point of argument and haughty in expression, he had conceived amortal enmity to me, which discovering itself whenever we met, Ideclin'd the proprietary's proposal that he and I should discuss theheads of complaint between our two selves, and refus'd treating withanyone but them. They then by his advice put the paper into the handsof the Attorney and Solicitor-General for their opinion and counselupon it, where it lay unanswered a year wanting eight days, duringwhich time I made frequent demands of an answer from theproprietaries, but without obtaining any other than that they had notyet received the opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor-General. Whatit was when they did receive it I never learnt, for they did notcommunicate it to me, but sent a long message to the Assembly drawnand signed by Paris, reciting my paper, complaining of its want offormality, as a rudeness on my part, and giving a flimsy justificationof their conduct, adding that they should be willing to accommodatematters if the Assembly would send out _some person of candour_ totreat with them for that purpose, intimating thereby that I was notsuch. The want of formality or rudeness was, probably, my not havingaddress'd the paper to them with their assum'd titles of True andAbsolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania, which Iomitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper, the intention ofwhich was only to reduce to a certainty by writing, what inconversation I had delivered _viva voce_. But during this delay, the Assembly having prevailed with Gov'r Dennyto pass an the proprietary estate in common with theestates of the people, which was the grand point in dispute, theyomitted answering the message. When this came over, the proprietaries, counselled byParis, determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent.Accordingly they petitioned the king in Council, and a hearing wasappointed in which two lawyers were employ'd by them against the act,and two by me in support of it. They alledg'd that the to load the proprietary estate in order to spare those of thepeople, and that if it were suffer'd to continue in force, and theproprietaries, who were in odium with the people, left to their mercyin proportioning the taxes, they would inevitably be ruined. Wereply'd that the no such intention, and would have no sucheffect. That the assessors were honest and discreet men under an oathto assess fairly and equitably, and that any advantage each of themmight expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting that of theproprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves.This is the purport of what I remember as urged by both sides, exceptthat we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequences that mustattend a repeal, for that the money, £100,000, being printed and givento the king's use, expended in his service, and now spread among thepeople, the repeal would strike it dead in their hands to the ruin ofmany, and the total discouragement of future grants, and theselfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such a generalcatastrophe, merely from a groundless fear of their estate being taxedtoo highly, was insisted on in the strongest terms. On this, LordMansfield, one of the counsel, rose, and beckoning me took me into theclerk's chamber, while the lawyers were pleading, and asked me if Iwas really of opinion that no injury would be done the proprietaryestate in the execution of the act. I said certainly. "Then," says he,"you can have little objection to enter into an engagement to assurethat point." I answer'd, "None at all." He then call'd in Paris, andafter some discourse, his lordship's proposition was accepted on bothsides; a paper to the purpose was drawn up by the Clerk of theCouncil, which I sign'd with Mr. Charles, who was also an Agent of theProvince for their ordinary affairs, when Lord Mansfield returned tothe Council Chamber, where finally the law was allowed to pass. Somechanges were however recommended and we also engaged they should bemade by a subsequent law, but the Assembly did not think themnecessary; for one year's tax having been levied by the theorder of Council arrived, they appointed a committee to examine theproceedings of the assessors, and on this committee they put severalparticular friends of the proprietaries. After a full enquiry, theyunanimously sign'd a report that they found the tax had been assess'dwith perfect equity. The Assembly looked into my entering into the first part of theengagement, as an essential service to the Province, since it securedthe credit of the paper money then spread over all the country. Theygave me their thanks in form when I return'd. But the proprietarieswere enraged at Governor Denny for having pass'd the act, and turn'dhim out with threats of suing him for breach of instructions which hehad given bond to observe. He, however, having done it at the instanceof the General, and for His Majesty's service, and having somepowerful interest at court, despis'd the threats and they were neverput in execution.... APPENDIX ELECTRICAL KITE To Peter Collinson , Oct. 19, 1752. Sir, As frequent mention is made in public papers from Europe of thesuccess of the _Philadelphia_ experiment for drawing the electric firefrom clouds by means of pointed rods of iron erected on highbuildings, &c., it may be agreeable to the curious to be informed,that the same experiment has succeeded in _Philadelphia_, though madein a different and more easy manner, which is as follows: Make a small cross of two light strips of cedar, the arms so long asto reach to the four corners of a large, thin silk handkerchief whenextended; tie the corners of the handkerchief to the extremities ofthe cross, so you have the body of a kite; which being properlyaccommodated with a tail, loop, and string, will rise in the air, likethose made of paper; but this being of silk, is fitter to bear the wetand wind of a thunder-gust without tearing. To the top of the uprightstick of the cross is to be fixed a very sharp-pointed wire, rising afoot or more above the wood. To the end of the twine, next the hand,is to be tied a silk ribbon, and where the silk and twine join, a keymay be fastened. This kite is to be raised when a thunder-gust appearsto be coming on, and the person who holds the string must stand withina door or window, or under some cover, so that the silk ribbon may notbe wet; and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frameof the door or window. As soon as any of the thunder clouds come overthe kite, the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them, andthe kite, with all the twine will be electrified, and the loosefilaments of the twine will stand out every way and be attracted by anapproaching finger. And when the rain has wet the kite and twine, sothat it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it streamout plentifully from the key on the approach of your knuckle. At thiskey the phial may be charged; and from electric fire thus obtained,spirits may be kindled, and all the electric experiments be performed,which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube,and thereby the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightningcompletely demonstrated. B. Franklin. THE WAY TO WEALTH (From "Father Abraham's Speech," formingthe preface to Poor _Richard's Almanac_ for 1758.) It would be thought a hard Government that should tax its Peopleone-tenth Part of their _Time_, to be employed in its Service. But_Idleness_ taxes many of us much more, if we reckon all that is spentin absolute _Sloth_, or doing of nothing, with that which is spent inidle Employments or Amusements, that amount to nothing. _Sloth_, bybringing on Diseases, absolutely shortens Life. _Sloth, like Rust,consumes faster than Labor wears; while the used key is always bright,as Poor Richard says. But dost thou love Life, then do not squanderTime, for that's the stuff Life is made of, as Poor Richard_ says. Howmuch more than is necessary do we spend in sleep, forgetting that _Thesleeping Fox catches no Poultry_, and that _There will be sleepingenough in the Grave_, as _Poor Richard_ says. _If Time be of all Things the most precious, wasting Time must be, asPoor Richard_ says, _the_ _greatest Prodigality_; since, as heelsewhere tells us, _Lost Time is never found again; and what we callTime enough, always proves little enough_: Let us then up and bedoing, and doing to the Purpose; so by Diligence shall we do more withless Perplexity. _Sloth makes all Things difficult, but Industry alleasy_, as _Poor Richard_ says; and _He that riseth late must trot allDay, and shall scarce overtake his Business at Night; while Lazinesstravels so slowly, that Poverty soon overtakes him_, as we read in_Poor Richard_, who adds, _Drive thy Business, let not that drivethee_; and _Early to Bed, and early to rise, makes a Man healthy,wealthy, and wise._ _Industry need not wish, and he that lives upon Hope will diefasting._ _There are no Gains without Pains._ _He that hath a Trade hath an Estate; and he that hath a Calling, hathan Office of Profit and Honor_; but then the _Trade_ must be workedat, and the _Calling_ well followed, or neither the _Estate_ nor the_Office_ will enable us to pay our Taxes. What though you have found no Treasure, nor has any rich Relation leftyou a Legacy, _Diligence is the Mother of Good-luck_, as _PoorRichard_ says, _and God gives all Things to Industry_. _One To-day is worth two To-morrows_, and farther, _Have you somewhatto do To-morrow, do it To-day_. If you were a Servant, would you not be ashamed that a good Mastershould catch you idle? Are you then your own Master, _be ashamed tocatch yourself idle_. Stick to it steadily; and you will see great Effects, for _ConstantDropping wears away Stones_, and by _Diligence and Patience the Mouseate in two the Cable_; and _Little Strokes fell great Oaks_. Methinks I hear some of you say, _Must a Man afford himself noLeisure_? I will tell thee, my friend, what _Poor Richard_ says,_Employ thy Time well, if thou meanest to gain Leisure; and, sincethou art not sure of a Minute, throw not away an Hour_. Leisure, isTime for doing something useful; this Leisure the diligent Man willobtain, but the lazy Man never; so that, as _Poor Richard_ says, _ALife of Leisure and a Life of Laziness are two things_. _Keep thy Shop, and thy Shop will keep thee_; and again, _If you wouldhave your business done, go; if not, send._ If you would have a faithful Servant, and one that you like, serveyourself. _A little Neglect may breed great Mischief:_ adding, _for want of aNail the Shoe was lost; for want of a Shoe the Horse was lost; and forwant of a Horse the Rider was lost, being overtaken and slain by theEnemy; all for the want of Care about a Horse-shoe Nail_. So much for Industry, my Friends, and Attention to one's own Business;but to these we must add _Frugality_. _What maintains one Vice, would bring up two Children_. You may thinkperhaps, that a _little_ Tea, or a _little_ Punch now and then, Diet a_little_ more costly, Clothes a _little_ finer, and a _little_Entertainment now and then, can be no _great_ Matter; but rememberwhat _Poor Richard_ says, _Many a Little makes a Mickle._ _Beware of little expenses; A small Leak will sink a great Ship_; andagain, _Who Dainties love, shall Beggars prove_; and moreover, _Foolsmake Feasts, and wise Men eat them._ Buy what thou hast no Need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thyNecessaries. If you would know the Value of Money, go and try to borrow some; for,he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing. The second Vice is Lying, the first is running in Debt. _Lying rides upon Debt's Back_. Poverty often deprives a Man of all Spirit and Virtue: '_Tis hard foran empty Bag to stand upright_. And now to conclude, _Experience keeps a dear School, but Fools willlearn in no other, and scarce in that_; for it is true, _we may giveAdvice, but we cannot give Conduct_, as _Poor Richard_ says: However,remember this, _They that won't be counseled, can't be helped_, as_Poor Richard_ says: and farther, That _if you will not hear Reason,she'll surely rap your Knuckles_. THE WHISTLE To Madame Brillon Passy, November 10, 1779. I am charmed with your description of Paradise, and with your plan ofliving there; and I approve much of your conclusion, that, in themeantime, we should draw all the good we can from this world. In myopinion, we might all draw more good from it than we do, and sufferless evil, if we would take care not to give too much for whistles.For to me it seems, that most of the unhappy people we meet with, arebecome so by neglect of that caution. You ask what I mean? You love stories, and will excuse my telling oneof myself. When I was a child of seven year old, my friends, on a holiday, filledmy pocket with coppers. I went directly to a shop where they sold toysfor children; and being charmed with the sound of a _whistle_, that Imet by the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered andgave all my money for one. I then came home, and went whistling allover the house, much pleased with my _whistle_, but disturbing all thefamily. My brothers, and sisters, and cousins, understanding thebargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it asit was worth; put me in mind what good things I might have bought withthe rest of the money; and laughed at me so much for my folly, that Icried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the_whistle_ gave me pleasure. This, however, was afterwards of use to me, the impression continuingon my mind; so that often, when I was tempted to buy some unnecessarything, I said to myself, _Don't give too much for the whistle_; and Isaved my money. As I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men, Ithought I met with many, very many, who _gave too much for thewhistle_. When I saw one too ambitious of court favor, sacrificing his time inattendance on levees, his repose, his liberty, his virtue, and perhapshis friends, to attain it, I have said to myself, _This man gives toomuch for his whistle_. When I saw another fond of popularity, constantly employing himself inpolitical bustles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them byneglect, _He pays, indeed_, said I, _too much for his whistle_. If I knew a miser who gave up every kind of comfortable living, allthe pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteem of his fellowcitizens, and the joys of benevolent friendship, for the sake ofaccumulating wealth, _Poor man_, said I, _you pay too much for yourwhistle_. When I met with a man of pleasure, sacrificing every laudableimprovement of the mind, or of his fortune, to mere corporealsensations, and ruining his health in their pursuit, _Mistaken man_,said I, _you are providing pain for yourself, instead of pleasure; yougive too much for your whistle_. If I see one fond of appearance, or fine clothes, fine houses, finefurniture, fine equipages, all above his fortune, for which hecontracts debts, and ends his career in a prison, _Alas_! say I, _hehas paid dear, very dear, for his whistle_. When I see a beautiful, sweet-tempered girl married to an ill-naturedbrute of a husband, _What a pity_, say I, _that she should pay so muchfor a whistle_! In short, I conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind arebrought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the valueof things, and by their _giving too much for their whistles_. Yet I ought to have charity for these unhappy people, when I consider,that, with all this wisdom of which I am boasting, there are certainthings in the world so tempting, for example, the apples of King John,which happily are not to be bought; for if they were put to sale byauction, I might very easily be led to ruin myself in the purchase,and find that I had once more given too much for the _whistle_. Adieu, my dear friend, and believe me ever yours very sincerely andwith unalterable affection, B. Franklin. A LETTER TO SAMUEL MATHER Passy, May 12, 1784. Revd Sir, It is now more than 60 years since I left Boston, but I remember wellboth your father and grandfather, having heard them both in thepulpit, and seen them in their houses. The last time I saw your fatherwas in the beginning of 1724, when I visited him after my first tripto Pennsylvania. He received me in his library, and on my taking leaveshowed me a shorter way out of the house through a narrow passage,which was crossed by a beam overhead. We were still talking as Iwithdrew, he accompanying me behind, and I turning partly towards him,when he said hastily, "_Stoop, stoop!_" I did not understand him, tillI felt my head hit against the beam. He was a man that never missedany occasion of giving instruction, and upon this he said to me, "_Youare young, and have the world before you; stoop as you go through it,and you will miss many hard thumps_." This advice, thus beat into myhead, has frequently been of use to me; and I often think of it, whenI see pride mortified, and misfortunes brought upon people by theircarrying their heads too high. B. Franklin.

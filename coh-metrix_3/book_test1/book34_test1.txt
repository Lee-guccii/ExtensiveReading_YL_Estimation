A new client The day it all started, I was sitting with my feet on the desk reading the newspaper. The window was open, and the room was filled with the smell of flowers from the balcony below my office. My name’s Mark Winters and I’m a P.I., a paranormal investigator. In many ways it’s a job similar to being a private investigator, except my clients don’t hire me to follow people; instead they want me to explain events they believe are supernatural. My office is in York, a city with plenty of ancient buildings, many of which have a reputation for being haunted. Of course, there’s often a perfectly logical explanation. That creepy noise that a client thinks is a ghost? Well, usually it turns out to be a faulty radiator or creaky stair that needs fixing. Mind you, not everyone wants to hear the truth. Even when I can demonstrate that nothing sinister is going on, some people prefer to hold onto the idea that the dead are trying to communicate with them. Still, it’s not my job to prove whether the supernatural exists or not. I just study the evidence and come up with the most reasonable explanation. My peace and quiet were interrupted by my secretary, Sheila, who began reading the newspaper over my shoulder. “Honestly, you read so slowly, Mark,” she said, reaching across and turning the page without asking me. There are a lot of things about Sheila that drive me crazy. She’s old enough to be my mother and has an annoying habit of treating me like a badly behaved ten-year-old. But, on the other hand, she’s the best assistant I’ve ever had, and I wouldn’t be able to run the office without her. “Look, this is interesting.” She ignored my frown of irritation and pointed to a story about an American actress called Cora Ray who was in the UK to film a TV series about haunted buildings. “I remember seeing her in horror films when I was a kid. She hasn’t been in anything for years,” I said. “Whenever there’s a new TV show about the supernatural, people start knocking at our door. Cora Ray might be good for business.” Sheila walked to her desk and picked up her coat. “I’ll take these letters to the post office and then I’m heading home.” After Sheila left, I enjoyed the silence and finished the newspaper. I was wondering what cheap restaurant to stop at for dinner when I heard a noise in the hall outside. It was the sound of high heels walking slowly across the wooden floor. A shadow appeared through the glass on the door, and after a short pause there was a tap on the glass. A young woman opened the door and took a step into the room. She was tall with dark brown eyes and a classy way of dressing. Her dark hair was tied back in a sleek ponytail. Without waiting to be asked, she took a seat, put her bag on her lap, and smiled at me as though we were two old friends who were meeting for a chat. “I presume you’re Mark Winters. That’s who the advertisement said to contact.” She smiled again, and I felt oddly pleased to hear her say my name. She smoothed down her skirt with manicured nails. A strand of hair fell across her face and she moved it away. She didn’t look like the usual sort of person who needs my help. I cleared my throat. “That’s right, I’m Mark Winters. What can I do for you?” “My name’s Jessica Styles. I’m here on behalf of my employer. You see, some strange things have started to happen at the house where we’re staying.” “What kind of things?” She looked down at her hands and then glanced up through her eyelashes. “It would be best if you could come and see for yourself.” Taking a diary out of a drawer, I turned the pages pretending to look through appointments. “This is very short notice,” I said. “Perhaps I could fit in an appointment toward the end of the week.” “You don’t understand.” She leaned forward in her chair and her voice was suddenly urgent. “My employer wants you to start work on this immediately. You’ll be paid extremely well if you drop your other cases and work exclusively on this.” She put her hand on the edge of the desk. “And I’d be very grateful, too. The things that have been happening, well, I just can’t explain them.” “Most things have a logical explanation no matter how strange they seem,” I said, trying to reassure her. “I hope you’re right, Mr. Winters.” Her employer sounded like someone who was used to giving commands. Well, I wasn’t someone who usually followed orders. But on the other hand the phrase “paid extremely well” was something I hadn’t heard in a long time. It also meant that I’d get to spend a little more time with the intriguing Miss Styles. I closed the diary and put it back in the drawer. “OK, you win. Wait there while I get my coat,” I said. She rewarded me with another smile. Falcon Lodge Her driver was waiting for us in the car downstairs. It was a classic Mercedes and the fair-haired guy in the driving seat hardly gave us a glance as we got in. “So where are we heading?” I asked as we drove off. “The house is called Falcon Lodge. You might have heard of it.” I nodded. Falcon Lodge was well known in the area. In the thirties, it was owned by Devlin Cale, an artist who was also supposed to be some kind of wizard. There were tales about him carrying out strange experiments mixing art and magic and threatening to put spells on people he didn’t like. I remembered reading somewhere that he disappeared in mysterious circumstances. Since then the house had gained a bad reputation and local people weren’t keen to go near because they said it was haunted. Jessica was quiet during the drive. Whenever I tried to ask her questions about her employer’s problem, she said, “It’ll be easier to explain when we arrive at the house.” We drove out of the city and through villages into the green hills of the countryside. After about half an hour we turned into a long driveway lined with dark woods on both sides. The road opened up and we drove around a small lake. That’s when I saw Falcon Lodge for the first time. I whistled under my breath. “Your employer has a nice little place here.” “It’s pretty impressive, isn’t it,” Jessica agreed. The dark windows of Falcon Lodge stared down at us. Five tall chimneys cast long shadows across the roof. Jessica was right, it was impressive, but I could understand why someone might think strange things could happen inside those walls. We walked up stone steps to the wide front door. It was opened by a gray-haired man in a black suit and white shirt; he certainly didn’t look pleased to see us. Jessica introduced me, “Mr. Winters, this is Mr. Carlyle, our butler.” I nodded to him but he continued glaring at me. After closing the door, he walked away without saying a word. “Sorry, Carlyle thinks the house already has a bad reputation with the local people. He says that people will gossip if we hire a paranormal investigator,” Jessica apologized. “I guess I’m lucky that he’s not the person employing me then. What other staff work here?” “There’s Bethan—she’s Carlyle’s wife. She cooks and looks after the house. Then there’s Greg, the chauffeur who drove us here. Oh, and there’s also Dr. Alex Cross, he’s my employer’s personal medical adviser.” “Your employer has quite a team. What exactly is your job?” I asked. “I do a bit of everything. I’m a kind of general assistant.” “Why don’t you tell me what’s been going on here.” “Of course. Follow me and I’ll show you.” Jessica led me through a dining room that was bigger than my whole flat. The walls were covered with so many paintings that it reminded me of a museum. I don’t know a lot about art, but even I could recognize the Picasso and Monet that we passed. I paused by the fireplace. There was a portrait of a man in a purple cloak. His silver hair was swept back. “I’ve seen this painting in a book. That’s Devlin Cale, isn’t it?” “Yes.” She shivered. “It’s a self-portrait. His eyes seem to follow you around the room.” I followed her to the end of a long corridor. She pushed open the heavy oak door and we entered a large, dark room. Jessica walked over to the window and opened the curtains, letting in the weak evening light. The room remained dim and had a cold, neglected feel. There were only a few pieces of furniture and they were all covered with white sheets. My attention was drawn to a painting on the wall and I took a step toward it. Slowly, I realized that I was looking at a painting of Falcon Lodge. But it was like a house from a nightmare, with terrified faces peering from many of the windows as red flames danced behind them. A figure had also been painted standing near the main door—a tall man in a purple robe with flowing silver hair. He was bowing and holding out his arms as though welcoming the viewer to step inside the house. At first I thought he was grinning—his lips were pulled back from his teeth—but when I looked more closely, his expression seemed filled with fury. “The figure in purple, is that Devlin Cale?” I asked. Jessica nodded; she seemed reluctant to get too close to the painting. “Yes, that’s him. It’s the last thing he painted before he disappeared,” she said. There were quite a few theories about what had happened to Cale. Some people said he had drowned in an accident on the lake, but his body had never been found. Others thought that he had disappeared after one of his magic experiments went wrong. I turned back to the painting. There was certainly something strange about it. I didn’t like looking at it, but at the same time, I couldn’t seem to look away. “It’s certainly an unpleasant painting, but what does it have to do with the problems you’re having in this house?” I asked. Jessica crossed her arms as though she was cold. “Soon after we moved in, the painting was found in a cupboard in the attic. It was moved downstairs, and almost immediately, strange things started happening.” I took a step toward the painting and reached out to touch the frame. “Don’t touch it.” A deep voice behind us made us both jump. Without making a sound, a woman had entered the room. Her hair was dyed red, matching her long fingernails, and she wore a long evening dress and diamonds. “You frightened us!” Jessica laughed. She walked over to the older woman and took her arm. “Mr. Winters, I’d like to introduce you to my employer, Miss Cora Ray.” I recognized the woman’s large blue eyes and long eyelashes from the horror films that I had seen as a teenager. Now her face was wrinkled, but as she moved toward me she still walked like a film star on a red carpet. When she held out her hand, I wasn’t sure if she expected me to shake it or kiss it. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Miss Ray. I read in the newspaper that you’re over here to make a TV series.” “That’s correct, Mr. Winters. Thank you for coming. I do hope I didn’t startle you. I’m glad that you’ve had a chance to look at the painting. You see, I’m convinced that it has an evil influence on this house and everyone in it.” She put her hand to her throat with a gesture that could have come straight from one of her films. “What would you like me to do, Miss Ray?” I asked. She glanced toward the painting and then quickly looked away. “Mr. Winters, I want you to stay the night to get an idea of what we have been experiencing here. Tomorrow we can talk about how you might be able to help us.” I hesitated. “I don’t have any of my equipment with me. It might be better if I return tomorrow when I have everything I need.” “Tomorrow you can go get all of your gadgets, Mr. Winters, but tonight I just want you to get a feel for the house. And to be frank, both Jessica and I will feel safer if there is someone here who has experience with supernatural occurrences.” My initial impression about Jessica’s employer had been right: she was definitely a person who was used to getting her own way. I didn’t like the idea of being told how to do my job, but my curiosity about Falcon Lodge was stronger than my pride. The opportunity to spend the night under its roof was attractive, and it also meant that I might get a chance to talk to Jessica some more. Miss Ray took my arm firmly and we walked toward the door. “So it’s decided, you’ll stay? Good. I do hope you enjoy the dinner we’ve planned for you. Jessica, tell Carlyle to light the fire in the dining room. Looking at that horrible painting always makes me feel so cold.” Behind us, Jessica closed the curtains and we left the painting in darkness once more. Killer painting? Dinner was served in Cora Ray’s grand dining room. Whatever Jessica’s job was, she was obviously senior to the other staff in the house because she ate at the same table as her employer rather than with the other servants. She smiled at me across the table and the candlelight danced against her pale face. “Tell me about the things that have happened since the painting was moved,” I said. “Well, to start with there were dreams,” Jessica said, glancing at Cora Ray. “That’s right.” Cora Ray nodded. “I had the most awful nightmare. I dreamed that Devlin Cale was trying to step out of the painting and talk to me. It was absolutely terrifying and I woke up screaming.” “On another occasion, Miss Ray was in her bedroom when she thought she heard a voice whispering, telling her that the painting had a message for her. I heard her scream and ran to her room,” Jessica said. “And when you got there, did you hear the voice, too?” I asked. “No, by the time Jessica reached my bedroom the whispering had stopped.” Cora Ray leaned forward and her jewels sparkled. “A week later, the same thing happened again: a hideous, evil whispering voice in the middle of the night. As you can imagine, it’s been terrible for my nerves.” Miss Ray closed her eyes and shuddered. “Did anyone else witness this?” I asked. Cora opened her eyes. “What are you suggesting, Mr. Winters? You don’t believe me?” she asked sharply. I chose my words carefully. “I believe you thought you heard something. I just need to work out exactly what is happening and why.” “It’s happening because we disturbed the painting, of course. You’re a paranormal investigator, Mr. Winters. You must know that objects can be cursed?” Cora lowered her voice dramatically. “In my experience, it’s best to look for logical explanations first. Look, why don’t you just put the painting back in the attic where you found it and see if the strange things stop happening?” “I can’t let anyone touch the painting again. Not after what happened to poor Doug.” Cora’s large blue eyes filled with tears and she put her hand over her mouth. Jessica quickly moved to the back of Cora’s chair and put a hand on her shoulder. “Doug Perkins was Miss Ray’s lawyer,” Jessica explained. “He was at Falcon Lodge helping Miss Ray to value her artwork. After we made a note of all the paintings in the main rooms, he suggested searching the rest of the building in case the previous owner had put anything interesting into storage. It was Doug who found Devlin Cale’s painting in the attic where it had been locked in a cupboard. Miss Ray asked him to bring it downstairs.” “It’s not exactly an attractive artwork. Why move it in the first place?” I said. Jessica glanced at her employer and shrugged. “They thought it might be valuable. Doug explained to Miss Ray that he had an appointment with an art expert in London the following day to discuss some pieces belonging to another client. He offered to take the painting with him to get it valued. Miss Ray agreed, and he took the painting home with him.” Jessica stopped speaking and bit her lip. “And what happened?” “That night there was a fire at his house, and Doug died. Almost everything in his house was destroyed, except the painting.” Both women looked upset. I’ve been involved in quite a few cases where a client thought an object had supernatural powers. “It’s certainly a horrible coincidence, but it still doesn’t prove that Doug’s death was connected to the painting.” Cora Ray got up and went to a small antique desk in the corner of the room. She opened a drawer, took out a piece of paper, and handed it to me. The edges were torn and it was yellow with age; the words had been written with such force that they seemed carved into the paper. “I found it in the attic after Doug died. It was in the same cupboard where we discovered the painting,” Jessica explained. Cora Ray grabbed my hand. “Don’t you understand what we’re trying to tell you? That painting killed Doug Perkins, and I believe it will kill again,” she said. A scream in the night After the meal, Cora Ray rose, saying that she wanted to go to her room. Jessica started to get up, but Miss Ray shook her head. “I’ll be fine, Jessica. Stay and talk to Mr. Winters.” She smiled and shook my hand, but she looked tired. After Cora left, I turned to Jessica. “Tell me honestly, do you really believe the painting is cursed?” I asked. I thought of Cora Ray’s dramatic entrance when I tried to touch the painting. Every word and gesture reminded me that she was an actress. Jessica ran her hand though her ponytail. “To be honest, I just don’t know what to think. I certainly think Miss Ray believes that the painting is evil.” “If she’s so frightened, why doesn’t she move away from this house?” Jessica looked down, and I sensed that there was something that she wasn’t telling me. “What is it?” I asked. “Miss Ray has a connection with Falcon Lodge. Her elderly cousin died recently and left her this house. Cora’s real name is Cora Cale. She’s the last surviving member of the Cale family.” “So she’s related to Devlin Cale?” “That’s right. He was her great-uncle.” I gave a low whistle. “That sounds like a story designed by the publicity department of her new TV show. Why didn’t she mention that she was related to Cale?” “As you said, it sounds like a publicity stunt. Maybe she was worried that you wouldn’t take her seriously. Mark, you will help her, won’t you?” I nodded. I liked it when she used my first name; it made me feel closer to her somehow. “Don’t worry, I’ll find out what’s going on. Tomorrow morning I’ll take a closer look at the rest of the house,” I promised. Jessica reached across the table and her fingers brushed my hand. “Please be careful. I know it sounds crazy, but I’m beginning to wonder if Miss Ray’s right. I think there might be something evil in this house.” “I think it would be useful to sleep in the same room as the painting. I just wish I had some of my equipment with me.” “No, Cora wouldn’t allow that, I’m afraid. She thinks it’s too dangerous. Anyway, before you arrived, she already asked Mrs. Carlyle to get the best guest bedroom ready for you.” I raised an eyebrow in surprise. “She must have been pretty sure I’d accept her invitation.” “Miss Ray usually gets what she wants,” Jessica said, and we exchanged a smile. When I saw my room, I was glad that I had accepted Cora’s invitation, even if it had been delivered as an order. It was decorated in gold and blue, and felt as luxurious as a five- star hotel. I made some notes about the case and soon after getting into the large, soft bed, fell asleep. At 3 a.m. a scream tore through the night. At first I thought it was a nightmare, but I could still hear the sound echoing around the house after I sat up. The scream sounded again, long and high. I tried to turn on the light next to the bed, but it wasn’t working. Stumbling out the door, I saw that the landing was in darkness too. Putting my hand against the wall, I found my way to the top of the stairs. I was just about to make my way down when I saw a light in the corridor. “Who’s there?” I called. Somewhere downstairs I could hear voices shouting. As the light came closer I saw that it was Jessica, holding a candle. “Was there really a scream or did I dream it?” she asked, rubbing her eyes sleepily. “Something’s going on downstairs. Here, take my arm.” She held onto me as we carefully walked down the stairs. At the bottom, the moon shone through the large hall window and made patterns on the floor. The scream came again, closer this time. “It’s coming from that direction,” Jessica said, pointing down a dark corridor. Two other figures appeared in the darkness, one was a short woman with gray hair wearing a ghostlike white nightdress. “Mrs. Carlyle, what’s happening?” Jessica asked. At the same moment I saw the butler, Mr. Carlyle, standing behind his wife. The screaming was coming from inside the room that contained Devlin Cale’s painting. Carlyle banged on the door. “It’s locked from the inside,” he shouted. “We’ll have to break it down.” We both put our shoulders against it, but soon I realized that the door was made of solid oak and wasn’t going to open. “Wait here!” I ordered. I took one of the candles, hurried to the main hall, and unlocked the door. There were no clouds that night, and the moon shone silver over the garden. I blew out the candle and ran around the side of the house until I came to the low window where we had heard the screaming. I tried to open the window, but it wouldn’t move. Bending down, I picked up a rock from the garden, smashed the glass, and put my hand through to open the lock. The room was suddenly silent as I climbed inside. It was a warm night outside, but inside the room the temperature felt icy. Cora Ray lay on the ground. I rushed over and checked her breathing, relieved to find that she was alive. I was about to light a candle when I saw a glow out of the corner of my eye. The flames in the painting on the wall seemed to blaze and flicker as brightly as a real fire. For a moment, the figures in the painting also appeared to move. The mouths on each face were open in silent screams. It’s only a trick of the moonlight, I tried to tell myself, but my hand shook as I reached inside my pocket for a match to light the candle. I rushed to the door, but the key wasn’t in the lock. Taking a step back, I ran my hands along the floor and eventually touched the key, grabbing it tightly. Even though I didn’t want to, I couldn’t help glancing over my shoulder at the painting. My eyes rested on the painted figure of Devlin Cale in his purple cloak. In the moonlight, his eyes seemed to blaze with fury. At last I was able to turn the key in the lock and throw open the door. Carlyle and his wife helped me carry Cora Ray to the library and put her gently on the couch. Jessica knelt beside her employer and took her hand. “She’s so cold. What happened in there?” Instead of answering, I took out my phone and called an ambulance. Then I took a deep breath and made myself walk back into the room where the painting hung. The house lights suddenly came on again and the mysterious shadows in the room disappeared. The temperature now felt the same as the rest of the house. What had happened in there? Had it all been my imagination? Back in the library, Cora Ray lay on the sofa making low moaning sounds, as though she were trapped in a bad dream. The press calls In the morning light, the office looked reassuringly normal and familiar. Sheila put a cup of hot coffee and a plate of toast on the desk. “You look like you need it,” she said. “Any more news on Cora Ray?” I took a bite of the toast. “The doctor says she’s making a good recovery. They’re planning to let her out of the hospital later.” I took another bite and studied Sheila’s frown. “What’s on your mind?” I asked. “Well, don’t you think it’s strange that Cora Ray has all these problems with a haunted painting just as her new TV show is about to start?” I’d been thinking the same thing. But I remembered the painting glowing in the moonlight and the terrified faces that seemed to move at its windows. If Cora was acting, then it was a good performance. Her screams had sounded pretty real to me. Sheila looked at my doubtful expression and shrugged. “Once this story gets into the media and Cora Ray’s show gets plenty of publicity, don’t be surprised if she doesn’t need you to work on the case any longer.” Later that morning, I contacted an old friend Nathan Lee, a fireman with connections in the fire service. I asked him to get me some information about the fire at Doug Perkins’ house. Nathan promised that he would check the fire report and call me if anything was suspicious. After writing some notes about the case, I was pouring another cup of coffee when the phone rang. “Is that Mark Winters?” The voice on the phone didn’t wait for a response. “Jim Mathews here from The Daily Globe newspaper. I’m calling about the recent events at Falcon Lodge. Can you give us a quote about the haunted painting?” “Where did you get my number?” I demanded, though I had a pretty good idea. “Cora Ray mentioned your name in an interview she gave to one of our journalists. She says you’re a well- known paranormal investigator. Is that right?” He was still talking when I put down the phone. I shook my head in disbelief; so Cora Ray really was using the events at Falcon Lodge to get people interested in her new TV show. Grabbing my coat, I left the office and slammed the door behind me. I intended to find out exactly what was going on. Even the bright sunshine couldn’t make Cora Ray’s house look cheerful. I parked the car and hurried up the stone steps and rang the bell on the huge front door. It was opened by Carlyle, and today he looked even less pleased to see me. “I’m here to see Miss Ray,” I said. “Miss Ray is not at home.” “That’s OK, I’ll wait.” I put a hand out to push the door open but Carlyle had already started to close it. I managed to get my foot inside. “I’ll tell Miss Ray that you called. Now please leave,” he ordered. “Is he giving you trouble, Mr. Carlyle?” I turned to see Greg the driver glaring at me. “Show Mr. Winters to his car, please, Greg.” The younger man reached out to take my arm, but I shook it off. “You two both seem to have a problem with me,” I observed. “Do you want to tell me why?” Greg folded his arms. “Maybe we don’t like the idea of some crook taking money off Miss Ray pretending to be a ghost hunter,” he said. He looked like he was hoping for a fight so I tried to keep my voice reasonable. “Look, I’m not a ghost hunter. I just gather evidence.” “You should stay out of things you don’t understand,” Carlyle said. “There are stranger things in this house than you know about. The last thing Miss Ray needs is someone frightening her like you did last night.” “I didn’t do anything last night. I was the one that rescued her, remember?” “Something in this house doesn’t like you,” Carlyle said, folding his arms. “It’s time for you to leave.” Greg took a step toward me and grabbed my arm. He was a big guy and he moved quickly. I tried to shake his hand off but couldn’t get him to let go. So I gave him a push and suddenly he was falling backwards down the steps. Carlyle called out and his wife appeared. Before I knew it, she was yelling at me, too. “What’s all this noise? Greg, what happened to you?” Jessica appeared at the door. She hurried down the steps and bent over Greg, who was sitting looking dazed. “Winters pushed him. I saw it with my own eyes.” Mrs. Carlyle glared at me. “Mr. Carlyle, help Greg inside and get him a glass of water.” Jessica soon took charge of the situation. Greg gave me another glare as he limped past. The guy looked like he had more muscle than brains. “I’m so sorry about that; are you all right?” Jessica asked as we watched the three figures retreat inside the house. “Forget it. How’s Miss Ray doing?” I asked. “She’s doing fine. The hospital let her out this morning.” “So where is she now?” I asked, though I already had a pretty good idea what the answer would be. “She’s at the television studio giving an interview for her new show.” “Will this interview include a description of the haunted painting and her ‘terrifying experience’ in the locked room?” I asked. “Look, I know it looks bad.” Jessica put her hand on my arm and stepped closer. “But you don’t really believe she’s making up a story like this, do you?” “Cora Ray has no right to give my name to the press when I haven’t had time to carry out a proper investigation. Tell her to stop giving interviews until we work out what’s really going on at Falcon Lodge, and then she can tell the whole world if she wants.” I noticed that Jessica looked uncomfortable. “Is there something you’re not telling me?” I asked. “Mark, I’m so sorry. Miss Ray says she wants you to drop the case immediately. She thinks your presence is making the painting angry. I’ve told her that I think it’s a bad idea, but she won’t listen to me.” A sleek new sports car circled the drive and came to a stop in front of the house. A tall, dark-haired man in his thirties got out. “Is everything all right?” he asked, looking from me to Jessica. “Everything’s fine. Mark, this is Dr. Alex Cross, Cora’s medical adviser.” Dr. Cross shook my hand quickly and then glanced at his watch. “I hope I’m not interrupting anything, but I’m on my way to see Miss Ray at the studio. She wants me to bring you along too, Jessica. I think she has some errands for you.” “You go right ahead. I was just leaving anyway,” I said coldly. Jessica hesitated and for a moment I thought she was about to stay. But then she turned and got into the car next to Dr. Cross. Off the case I was too angry to go back to work so I drove around for a while. When I finally arrived at the office, Sheila told me that Nathan had called about the fire report. He said that the fire at Doug Perkins’ house had been caused by an electrical problem, and there were no suspicious circumstances. “OK, thanks. Anything else?” “Jessica Styles phoned just before you arrived. She didn’t want to leave a message.” Sheila had a disapproving look when she mentioned Jessica’s name. She can be like that when she thinks a female client might be taking an interest in me. Not that Jessica had any interest in me, I told myself. I already felt badly about the way that I’d talked to Jessica and part of me wanted to call her back immediately. But first I wanted to do some research into Devlin Cale’s painting. Cora Ray might want me to stop working on the case, but by talking to the media she had involved me in her story. So now I intended to find out what was really going on. The library reading room was almost empty when I arrived, and the high windows didn’t let in much sun. Warm light from reading lamps shone on dark wooden desks. The gray-haired librarian walked past to check on me. I must look like the kind of guy who steals library books. I used a microfiche machine to look at copies of local newspapers from the thirties. Devlin Cale was a famous figure in this part of the world, so there was bound to be a news item about him or Falcon Lodge. After almost an hour I finally found something of interest. It was a newspaper report from 1938. I glanced at the photograph of Harry Quinn. He stared out of the photograph with wide blue eyes, looking young and hopeful. There was also a photo of Devlin Cale standing next to the hideous painting of Falcon Lodge soon after he had painted it. Cale had the wide grin of a champion, but his eyes were cold and hard. I looked more closely at the painting in the photograph. Something didn’t look right. I asked the librarian to print a copy of the article and then I slipped it into my file, intending to take a closer look later. As I packed away my things, I felt a hand on my shoulder. Turning, I found Jessica standing behind me. “I hope you don’t mind,” she said quietly. “I needed to speak to you. Is there somewhere we can get a coffee?” She looked tired. “How did you know where to find me?” I asked as we walked to a café. “I went to your office. Your secretary didn’t want to tell me, but I persuaded her that it was important. I don’t think she likes me very much.” “Don’t take it personally. She disapproves of most women under seventy who want to talk to me.” We found a seat at the back of the café and ordered our coffee. Jessica waited until the waitress had moved away and then leaned closer. “Mark, I know you’re not on the case anymore, but I need your advice. You see, I really think that there might be something wrong with Miss Ray.” “What makes you say that?” I asked. She was running her hand through her ponytail, something I had noticed she did when she felt nervous. “Well, she’s started to of strange. She’s not sleeping and she’s started thinking that things are being moved or stolen in the house. When she can’t find something, I go and look and it’s right where it should be.” She fell silent as the waitress arrived with our coffee. “A lot of people can be forgetful. It doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong.” I shrugged. “It’s not only that. Her behavior is getting really strange. You remember she told you that she heard a voice whispering to her about Devlin Cale’s painting? Well, that’s happened a few times.” “Have you spoken to Dr. Cross?” She shook her head. “Not yet.” “It sounds like Miss Ray might need a psychiatrist rather than a paranormal investigator, Jessica.” For a moment she looked down at her coffee cup. “You might be right. I noticed that you were looking at an article about Devlin Cale. Do you still have some interest in the case?” She looked up at me through her dark lashes. I was tempted to put my hand on hers and tell her that it wasn’t only the case that I was interested in. Instead I looked away. “I was just curious, that’s all. It seems that Devlin Cale liked publicity just as much as his great-niece.” Jessica smiled. “I’ve wanted to ask you: what made you become a paranormal investigator? It seems like a strange job for someone who seems to have so little belief in the supernatural.” “It’s not that I don’t believe. I just think that there’s usually a logical explanation.” I glanced at her, unsure whether to continue. Usually I avoided discussing how I got into the profession, but there was something about the way that Jessica sat watching me with her brown eyes that made me want to talk to her. “My father died when I was a teenager. Mom had problems accepting that he was gone. After a while, she started to think that he was trying to get a message to her.” I stopped, remembering the look on my mother’s face when she first told me that she knew that Dad wanted to speak to her. She had looked so hopeful. “Go on,” Jessica said gently. “She met a woman who said she could give her messages from Dad. Soon the woman started asking for money. She’d frighten Mom by saying that Dad was angry and wouldn’t send messages if she didn’t write a check. Mom spent thousands of pounds and all she got was a broken heart. It made me want to prove to people that there is often a logical explanation for most of these experiences.” “Do you really believe that?” Jessica asked. A strand of hair had fallen from her ponytail, and for a moment I wanted to smooth it back for her. “Yeah, I do. Either it’s someone wanting to believe that there’s a loved one trying to contor it’s a creepy old house that can make its owners see a ghost in every shadow. Sure there are cases that are difficult to explain, but usually it’s all in the person’s imagination. I honestly believe that most of the time there’s nothing to fear.” Jessica’s mobile phone beeped. She looked quickly at the text message and then put it back in her bag. “I’m sorry, I have to leave.” I put my hand out to stop her. “It’s my turn to ask a question. Why do you work for Cora Ray? You’re a smart girl. Why spend your time with a crazy old actress who makes you run around like a servant?” Jessica smiled sadly. “I need to go. If you find out anything about the painting, will you contI want to believe you when you say that there’s nothing to fear.” She stood and held out her hand for me to shake. It was an oddly old-fashioned gesture, but I took it because I wanted to feel her warmth. “Good-bye for now, Mark. I hope we meet again soon.” Finding Harry That evening I looked out the window of my flat. The trees in the park opposite moved in the wind, but the street was empty. Even so, I had a strange feeling that I was being watched. A jazz CD played quietly in the background as I sat down to read by the yellow light of the lamp. After a few minutes I became restless and took out the printout of the newspaper article from the library. I put the article on the table and studied it. What had convinced Harry Quinn that Cale was involved in his friend’s disappearance? I looked again at the black and white photograph of the painting of Falcon Lodge. Something about it still bothered me. Taking a magnifying glass from a drawer, I peered at the photograph of the painting. Suddenly I realized what was wrong. It was exactly the same painting that I had seen in Cora Ray’s house, yet there were fewer faces looking out from the windows. I glanced at the photo of Devlin Cale standing beside his newly completed painting. He seemed to be looking straight into my eyes, an amused look on his face. I shivered and rubbed my eyes. Too many late nights were playing tricks with my imagination, I decided. Before I went to bed I turned out the lights and stood by the window again. The empty street was lit by a silver moon. I couldn’t see anyone in the shadows, but I still had that feeling of being watched. You’ll end up as crazy as Cora Ray if you go on like this, I told myself. A few days passed and I tried not to think about Jessica, Cora Ray, and Falcon Lodge. Instead I took on one or two simple cases where the clients’ checks paid Sheila’s wages with enough left over for a regular diet of fast food for me. Sheila was making a pot of coffee in the office. “You look like you slept in your clothes,” she said as she frowned at my badly ironed shirt. A red light flashed on the phone. I poured myself a coffee and pushed the button to hear the messages. I recognized the first voice immediately. “Mr. Winters, you have to help me.” Cora Ray’s frightened whisper came out of the machine. “The painting. It’s getting worse. I think Devlin Cale’s trying to cont“Aren’t you going to call her back? She sounds terrified,” Sheila asked. “Instead of looking so disapproving, help me find out what’s going on. I need some information about a man called Harry Quinn. I’m not even sure if he’s still alive. If he is, he’ll be in his nineties by now.” Sheila shook her head but did as I asked. Picking up her coat, she headed for the door. When she had gone, I played the answering machine message again. I hated to admit it, but Sheila was right, Cora’s voice did sound terrified. But was she just acting again? I hesitated a moment and then grabbed the phone. Jessica answered after the second ring. “I’m returning Miss Ray’s call.” I tried not to show how pleased I was to hear her voice again. “Cora’s sleeping at the moment.” She spoke quietly as though trying not to be overheard. “She’s been saying some pretty strange things.” “She called and left me a message. She seems to think Devlin Cale’s trying to communicate with her.” Jessica sighed. “Yes, I know. That’s what she’s been telling me, too. Dr. Cross had to give her something to calm her down.” “Why does Cora think Cale wants to cont“She seems to think she has a connection with him because she’s the last surviving member of the Cale family.” “Do you want me to come over?” I asked. “Dr. Cross doesn’t think we should have any visitors until she’s calmer. I’m going to rest now because I was up most of the night trying to help her. She was getting more and more upset, wandering around the house listening for Cale’s voice. When she eventually got to sleep, we found a knife under her pillow that she must have taken from the kitchen when we weren’t looking. I’m worried she might hurt herself.” “Phone me if you need me,” I said. I didn’t like the idea of Jessica being in the house while Cora Ray was acting so strangely. Sheila returned triumphantly to the office with information about Harry Quinn. She had discovered that he was still alive and living in a home for elderly people in a village called Hovingham, twenty miles north of York. “The home is called The Glades. I called reception and made an appointment for you to visit. I said you wanted to interview Mr. Quinn for a book you’re writing.” “You’re a star, Sheila.” “I know.” She handed me the address and a photocopied map. “Remember that when I next ask for a raise.” The Glades looked like the kind of place that I wouldn’t mind living in when I retired. It was an attractive white building surrounded by trees and green lawns. The nurse at reception checked my name on the visitor’s list. She smiled up at me. “I hear you want to interview Harry for your book, Mr. Winters. What’s it about?” “It’s a history of ghost stories connected to York.” Sheila had obviously done a good job of making me sound like a respectable writer. I hoped that the nurse wouldn’t ask too many questions. She led me down a corridor and through a door that led to an attractive shaded garden. A lone figure was reading under a tree. We walked across the grass to where he sat. “Harry, this gentleman is Mr. Winters. He’s writing a book about ghosts in York. He’s here to interview you.” Harry Quinn looked up at me. His eyebrows and hair were white, but I could still see the shy smile of the boy in the photograph from the newspaper. He waited until the nurse had gone back to the house and then looked at me with intelligent blue eyes. “Well, Mr. Winters, I am certainly not an expert on York ghosts. So have you made a mistake or are you here for another reason?” I decided to tell him the truth. “I’m investigating a painting by Devlin Cale. It’s a picture of Falcon Lodge.” Harry’s smile disappeared and his face became pale. “I know the painting that you’re talking about,” he said quietly. “Where is it now?” “It’s at Devlin Cale’s house. I was hoping that you might be able to tell me something about it.” I sat down next to him. “I’m sorry that you had a wasted journey, Mr. Winters. But I don’t want to talk to you.” He picked up his book and seemed ready to move out of his chair and go back into the house. “Mr. Quinn, please wait. I need your help. How is the painting connected to the disappearance of Leo Drake?” Harry Quinn glared at me for a moment but remained in his chair. “What do you know about Leo Drake?” he demanded. I told him about the newspaper article I had found. Quinn stared down at his hands. “What do you plan to do? Write a cheap story about the painting to sell your book?” “I’m not a writer, Mr. Quinn. The reason I need to know about the painting is because there have been some strange incidents at Falcon Lodge recently.” “Why do you think they are connected to the painting?” Harry asked sharply. I didn’t mention Cora Ray’s name, but I told him some of the things that had happened. “I’ve spent years trying not to think about that painting,” Harry said quietly. “But I can’t let it destroy more lives.” He put his hand on his chest and started coughing. I asked whether I should get the nurse, but he shook his head. “Perhaps it’s time to finally tell someone what happened,” he said. He sat back in his chair, looking pale and tired. Then he turned and looked me in the eye. “When you leave here, you’ll think that I’m a mad old man. But I promise you that every word that I’m about to tell you is true.” Harry remembers “I was in my second year as a student at York University,” Harry said. “My best friend was Leo Drake, a brilliant science student.” “Devlin Cale came to speak at our university. He already had a reputation for mixing art and magic. Leo thought it was ridiculous. He believed Cale was nothing but a fraud.” Harry smiled sadly. “We were young, you see, and we thought that everything had a logical explanation.” “Anyway, he arrived at the university lecture wearing a long purple cloak like a wizard. He talked about his experiments with art and science. He seemed to believe they could explain the mysteries of the universe. I remember Leo and I looked at each other and laughed. After his talk, Cale announced that he would perform a ‘magical demonstration’ for the students. A canvas wrapped in velvet cloth was brought onto the stage along with paints and a paintbrush. The velvet cloth was taken off, and we could see that the canvas was empty— nothing was painted on it. Cale stood in front of it with his eyes closed in concentration. The lights were turned down and the room was almost dark. Smoke began to appear and drift over to the canvas.” Harry shook his head as though after all these years he still found it difficult to believe what he had seen. “I thought my eyes were playing tricks because the smoke seemed to form into the shape of a person. After a while, the smoke cleared and the lights were turned on again. The crowd gasped because where there had been an empty canvas, there was now a painting of Devlin Cale’s house, Falcon Lodge. Cale opened his eyes and looked triumphantly around the room.” Harry looked at me and went on, “He walked over to the painting and touched it, holding up his hand so that everyone could see that the paint was still wet. He told the audience that it had been painted by a spirit. He claimed that it was proof that his paintings combined art and science and were even powerful enough to communicate with the dead. I turned to speak to Leo, but he wasn’t in his seat. To my surprise, I saw him walking toward the stage.” “Leo was pointing at Cale and shouting, ‘This man is a fake! This sort of trick belongs in a cheap theater, not in a place of learning.’” “At first, Cale seemed amused. He said, ‘Ah, this young gentleman appears to want to lecture us on how these mysteries occur.’ And the audience laughed.” “But then Leo pushed past Cale and pulled back a curtain that covered the lower part of the stage. He explained to the audience that it hid a smoke machine used by Cale to create mysterious effects.” “Before anyone could stop him, Leo jumped onto the stage and picked up the painting. He said that Cale and his experiments were a fraud.” “The audience started crowding around the stage, looking at the machine that was hidden under it. Some got onto the stage and began examining the painting. Cale shouted at them to stand back, but they didn’t listen to him.” “Leo returned to his seat, laughing while Devlin Cale glared at him. The university professors hurried toward the stage, trying to get the students to return to their seats. I knew Leo would get into trouble, so I grabbed his arm and made him leave.” Harry paused a moment, shaking his head. “I wish I’d known what Leo intended to do because I would have tried to stop him. Leo was still in high spirits as we left the lecture hall, but I had a feeling that something bad was going to happen. The next morning, the head of our college demanded to see Leo. When he came out, Leo was very upset. He’d been expelled from the university for upsetting such an important guest. A guest, he was reminded, who was about to donate a large amount of money to our college. It was a very sad day when he left his rooms for the last time.” “A month later, I visited Leo at his family’s home in Scotland. I was shocked to see the change in my friend. He had lost weight and there were dark shadows under his eyes. He told me that soon after he had arrived home he received a parcel. It was Cale’s painting of Falcon Lodge. He showed me the note that arrived with it.” “Since the arrival of the painting, Leo had problems sleeping. His mother and younger sisters, Elly and Lydia, hated the painting, and so Leo kept it in his bedroom.” “I begged him to send the painting back to Cale, and finally, Leo agreed. When I caught the train back to university, I felt confident that Leo would soon be back to his old self once the painting was out of his life.” Harry was quiet for a moment as though lost in his thoughts. When he continued, his voice was heavy with sadness. “When I returned to university I wrote to Leo, but received no reply. It didn’t worry me unduly because he was never an enthusiastic letter writer. Four or five weeks went past and then I received a letter from Leo’s mother. She was worried about her son and wanted me to visit him again as soon as possible.“ “When I arrived at his home I discovered that Leo had broken his promise. He hadn’t sent the painting back to Devlin Cale. His mother told me that he rarely came out of his room anymore. He spent all day sitting, looking at the painting. I went straight to his room and knocked. The door was locked but, after a moment, I heard him moving about inside. He seemed to be talking to himself. I knocked again but he didn’t answer. Then I heard a sound behind the door. It was as though he was scratching the wood with his fingers. When he spoke, his voice was so quiet that I had to put my ear against the door to hear.” “‘The painting wants me, Harry,’ Leo said. ‘It’s going to take me.’ And then he laughed. It was a terrible sound, the high terrified laughter of a madman.” Harry shuddered at the memory and looked down at his hands. “I should have broken down the door or told his mother to call a doctor. I wish that I had. But the truth is that I was frightened and I didn’t know what to do. Instead I went back to my room to think. I have regretted that decision every day. That night, I lay awake in the darkness, listening. I hoped that Leo had fallen asleep and that in the morning I would finally persuade him to send back the painting.” “The next morning, Leo didn’t come down to breakfast. I went to his room and called out his name. The door was unlocked, but Leo’s room was empty. His bed had not been slept in. The painting was still on the wall but Leo’s chair had been knocked to the ground. On the table there was a note written in Leo’s handwriting. It looked as though his hand had been shaking as he wrote. It said simply: Give the painting back to Cale.” “I looked around the room in despair. On the floor in front of the painting there was a small dark patch where it looked as though something had been burned. Then I looked more closely at the painting. What I saw made me realize that I would never see my friend alive again.” Cora’s strange behavior Harry began coughing. He was weak after telling me his tale. “I’ll get you a glass of water,” I said. His hand gripped my arm. “Tell the people at Falcon Lodge to beware. That painting is truly evil. I have more to tell you,” he whispered. He looked ill, his breath coming in gasps. I ran back to the house and called a nurse. When we returned, Harry had fallen from his seat and was lying on the grass under the tree. He was still breathing, but his eyes were closed. “We need to get him to the hospital,” the nurse said. I watched as they carried him to the ambulance and wondered whether Harry would ever be able to finish his tale. They wouldn’t let me go to the hospital with him. Instead, I drove home wondering if both he and Cora were crazy. They were both obsessed with the painting. But Sheila would probably say that I was obsessed with it, too. What had Harry seen when he looked at the painting in his friend’s room? Even the memory of it had made him ill. When I got back to the office, I was pleased to see that Sheila had already gone home. It meant that I could do some research about Devlin Cale without her looking over my shoulder. I wanted to find out more about Devlin Cale’s experiments, so I turned on my computer and found a website that specialized in stories about the paranormal. I looked through the contents and found a short article about Devlin Cale. I read it quickly until I came to the final paragraphs. The name Jerome Carlyle made me pause. It was the same surname as the butler at Falcon Lodge. But surely he couldn’t be the same person mentioned in the article? Perhaps it was a relative. There was a knock at the door and Jessica came in. “I’m sorry, are you busy?” she asked. I noticed that her face was pale and there were dark shadows under her eyes. “Has something happened?” I asked. She walked over and sat on the edge of the desk. “I’m really worried about Miss Ray. For the last three nights she’s hardly slept at all. She just wanders around the house until dawn. Last night I listened at her door and it sounded like she was having a conversation with someone, but when I knocked and opened the door she was all alone. I’ve tried talking to her, but she insists that Devlin Cale is trying to communicate with her.” “Have you spoken about this to Dr. Cross yet?” I asked. Jessica nodded. “He’s arranging an appointment for Miss Ray to see a psychiatrist.” “Does she know about this?” Jessica shook her head. “No, it would only make her more anxious. I haven’t even mentioned it to Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle because they might tell her. Dr. Cross is worried Miss Ray might do something crazy. I don’t want to believe that, but when I look into her eyes she looks like a different person. I really think this obsession with Devlin Cale is making her ill. She needs more help than I can give her.” Perhaps Cora Ray’s collapse hadn’t been a publicity stunt. Whatever was happening in that house, I didn’t think it was safe for Jessica to be there. “Listen, I don’t believe in haunted paintings or in magicians, but I do think something strange is going on. I think you should leave the house and go and stay at a hotel for a few days until the psychiatrist sees Cora Ray.” “I have to stay; I can’t leave Miss Ray when she needs me.” She smiled sadly and I wanted to put my hand on hers. Jessica nodded toward my computer screen, which still showed the article about Devlin Cale. “Let me know if you find anything interesting. I feel like the more I know about Devlin Cale, the more I can help Cora. I think he’s the key to all this.” She wrote down her mobile phone number and handed it to me. After she left, I held the paper in my hand and stood by the window, watching her walk down the street until she disappeared around the corner. I didn’t want her to leave and go back to that house with Cora Ray and the strange Carlyle couple. The photograph The next morning I drove to The Glades to check on Harry. I spoke to one of the nurses, who told me that Harry was recovering well but she couldn’t let me see him. I tried to persuade her, but she shook her head and said that he was resting and only family were allowed to visit. She was pushing a cart carrying medicines. I noticed that she carried a list of patients with their room numbers and a list of the medicines that they needed. A quick glance showed that Harry was in G7, which I guessed was ground floor, room 7. I thanked her for her help and left. After parking the car in the village, I returned to The Glades on foot. Staying close to the trees, I walked around the side of the building and waited until everything was quiet. A male nurse was hurrying past, and I hid, waiting for him to pass by. Counting quietly, I looked inside the seventh window. It was open a little and I could see inside the room. I recognized Harry lying on the bed. His face was still pale, but he was looking a little better than the last time I had seen him. He opened his eyes and saw me, waving his hand to show that I should enter. Quietly opening the French windows, I stepped inside. “We don’t have much time. The nurse will soon be here with my medication,” Harry whispered. “I’m too tired to talk for long.” He pointed to a table in the corner. The only thing on it was an old photograph in a frame showing a group of laughing students. I carried it over to Harry, and he pointed to a young man with curly hair. “Leo,” Harry said. His hand dropped onto the bed again and he closed his eyes, exhausted. There were footsteps outside the door and I could hear medicine bottles rattling on a cart. Harry’s eyes opened again, staring urgently into my own. “The painting,” he gasped. “Leo wasn’t there and then he was.” “What do you mean, Harry? I don’t understand.” “The painting.” Harry repeated. His hand was clenched on the bed cover. There was no time for any more questions as the nurse was about to open the door. Harry pushed the old photograph into my hands and I left, closing the French windows behind me. I phoned Jessica and told her that I needed to see the painting again. She was worried that Cora would find me there and become upset. I quickly explained about the photograph that Harry had given me. “Do you think it might be important?” she asked. “I’m not sure. But I know Harry wanted me to see the painting again. He was too ill to give me any more information.” There was a moment’s silence while she decided what to do. “Come tonight, just after midnight when everyone should be asleep. I’ll let you in through the side door,” she agreed at last. I could hear someone calling in the background. “Who’s that?” “It’s Cora; she’s not feeling very well today. I should go and see what she wants.” “Has she seen the psychiatrist?” I asked. “Not yet, but it’s all arranged. Actually, Mark, it’d really help if you could be here next Friday to talk to the psychiatrist with me. Maybe you could tell him about the effect the painting has on Miss Ray. After all, you were there when she collapsed.” A couple of days ago I would have said yes. But after hearing Harry’s story it was more difficult to dismiss Cora as simply crazy or publicity hungry. I rubbed my forehead. “Jessica, this psychiatrist isn’t going to lock Cora away, is he?” She paused for a moment before answering. “Well, Dr. Cross says that we should be prepared for all possibilities.” “Including putting her in hospital against her will?” “Dr. Cross is only trying to do what’s best for her. We all are.” “Of course. Look, we’ll talk about it later.” I was surprised to realize that I suddenly felt sorry for Cora Ray. It was just after midnight when I arrived at Falcon Lodge. After parking my car at the end of the lane where it was out of sight from the house, I walked around the lake. An owl hooted in the garden, and the house was in darkness apart from a single light in a downstairs window. Jessica was waiting for me as arranged, and I felt my heart beat faster when I saw her standing in the doorway. She glanced behind her and put her finger to her lips. “Follow me,” she whispered. The house was silent as she opened the door to the room with the painting. “What are you looking for?” she asked. “I’m not sure, but it’s connected to this.” I took the photograph of Leo from my pocket and showed her. We walked toward the painting. I kept telling myself that it was only paint and canvas, there was nothing to fear. But I could still feel the hair rise on the back of my neck as we got closer. It was difficult to look closely at the painting. Unhappy faces stared out at us. I glanced at the photograph and studied the painting again. I could smell Jessica’s perfume as she stood close beside me. “Do you see anything?” she whispered. I shook my head. Harry’s memory of the painting had obviously become confused through time and illness. I knew I should go before someone discovered me in the house, but I didn’t want to move from Jessica’s side. I took a last look at Cale’s painting. That’s when I saw him. In the attic room of the house in the painting was a face I recognized from the photograph. I was staring into the terrified eyes of Leo Drake. I took a step back from the painting. “What is it?” asked Jessica, looking up at me with alarm. I pointed out Leo’s face. “So, Cale painted Leo. It’s a little creepy, but it doesn’t mean anything,” she said. “Leo Drake disappeared after saying that the painting wanted him. That’s what Harry was trying to tell me when he said ‘he wasn’t there and then he was.’ He meant that Leo wasn’t in the original painting, but after the incident in Leo’s room Harry believes his friend had somehow become trapped in the painting.” “Or maybe Harry simply didn’t notice that Leo was in the painting until after his friend disappeared. You always say that there’s a logical explanation to these things, Mark.” I suddenly felt ridiculous. She was right, of course. There were perfectly logical explanations as to why Leo’s face was in the painting. Suddenly an idea occurred to me and I grabbed her hand. “I have a printout of an old photo of Cale standing beside his painting. It was taken soon after he completed it. We can compare it to see if Leo was in the original painting.” “Ssh, I can hear something.” Jessica put her hand on my arm and we both listened. Someone was moving quietly along the corridor outside. We could see the light of a flashlight underneath the door. “Go now or I’ll get into trouble,” she said quietly and opened the window to let me out. Thief! As soon as I arrived back at my flat, I took out the file with the photograph of Cale standing beside his newly completed painting. Getting out a magnifying glass, I peered at the house in the painting beside him. It was difficult to see clearly, but I was pretty sure that Leo Drake’s face wasn’t in it. I rubbed my tired eyes and decided to look again in the morning light. But before I put the papers away I took one last look. What I noticed puzzled me even more. There was another figure missing: the figure of Cale wasn’t there. In the painting I saw at Falcon Lodge, Devlin Cale stood in front of the house as though welcoming visitors. So why wasn’t he in the original painting? That night I had a troubled sleep. I dreamt about Leo Drake, trapped forever in that hellish painting. In my dream, he banged on the window to get my attention, begging me to help him escape. When I woke, I sat up in bed with my hands over my ears to try to block out the noise echoing in my head. It took a few seconds to realize that the banging was real. Yawning, I quickly got dressed and hurried to the door. When I opened it, I found two police officers staring at me. They didn’t look like they had arrived on a social visit. “Mark Winters?” the older man asked. “That’s right. What can I do for you, officers?” I tried not to sound nervous but there’s something about finding the police at your door that makes you feel guilty even when you haven’t done anything wrong. The younger officer took a step toward me. “We’re here about a painting that was stolen from a property called Falcon Lodge. You were seen leaving the building at one o’clock this morning, around the time the painting went missing.” “Look, there’s obviously been some mistake . . .” “Do you admit that you were at Falcon Lodge?” The older officer took out a notebook and began writing. “Yes, I was there, but I didn’t take anything.” “And the owner, Cora Ray, she knew that you were on her property?” “No, she didn’t.” I rubbed my eyes with my finger and thumb, trying to think clearly. “So you admit that you were at Falcon Lodge, but without the owner’s permission?” “Well, yes. I suppose so. But it’s not the way it looks.” I knew it sounded bad. I wished that Jessica was with me. She’d have been able to confirm to the police that I was innocent. Maybe I could sort this out without mentioning her name. I didn’t want her to get into trouble with Cora Ray because of me. The two police officers glanced at each other. The older guy put his notebook in his jacket pocket. “You’ll have to accompany us to the police station, Mr. Winters. We need to ask you a few more questions.” I looked at their faces and realized that there was no point arguing or trying to explain. Shaking my head, I grabbed my coat and followed them to the police car parked outside. I’m not sure how long I would have been at the police station if it hadn’t been for Sheila’s help. She got me a lawyer, which was the only thing that stopped me from spending the night in the cell. I explained to the police officers that Jessica could confirm that I hadn’t stolen Cale’s painting, but they were unable to contEventually, they released me on condition that I didn’t go near Falcon Lodge and didn’t try to contwho lived there. “I told you that girl was trouble,” Sheila said through tight lips as she drove me back to my flat late that evening. “This has nothing to do with Jessica. While we were looking at the painting at Falcon Lodge we heard someone moving about in the corridor. Whoever it was must have seen me leave. Now they’re trying to get me into trouble by accusing me of stealing the painting.” “But why would anyone do that?” Sheila asked. “I don’t know. But I’m going to find out.” Sheila gave me a sharp look before I reminded her to keep her eyes on the road ahead. “Mark, promise me that you’ll stay away from Falcon Lodge and you won’t try to get in contJessica.” “I promise,” I said, but I could tell by her silence that she knew I was lying. Over the next few days I called Jessica a few times, but she still wasn’t answering her phone, and I started to get worried. Even though Sheila had warned me not to, I eventually called Falcon Lodge. Someone picked the phone up almost immediately, and I was surprised when Cora Ray answered. “Mr. Winters, I’m so glad you called. I need you to come over immediately.” Her voice sounded strange. “Is Jessica there?” I asked. Cora’s voice sounded strange, as though she had just woken from a deep sleep. “Why did you leave the case? I’ll pay you whatever you want. He’s trying to communicate with me, you see. He’s warning me.” It sounded like she really was losing her mind. She’d even forgotten that she’d fired me. “Will you help me, Mr. Winters?” she pleaded. I tried not to think about what Sheila would say if she were here. “OK, I’ll get there as soon as I can.” I said. There were dark shadows under Cora Ray’s eyes and her hair was untidy. She looked much older than the last time I had seen her. “Thank you for coming. He’s been talking to me for days now. But recently his voice has changed. Now he sounds angry.” “Who’s talking to you, Miss Ray?” I asked. She frowned at me as though I was being slow to understand. “Why, Devlin Cale, of course. He’s been talking to me every day. But now he’s started to frighten me. I want you to search the house and find him.” “Devlin Cale is dead,” I reminded her gently. “He always said that he would find a way to live forever. You don’t know how powerful he is, Mr. Winters.” She looked confused. Her eyes were very bright and her hands were shaking. “Come with me and I’ll show you where I hear his voice,” she said. The first place that she took me to was her bedroom. I searched the room to find any obvious places where noises might occur. “What does Devlin Cale say to you when he speaks to you?” I asked. “At first he gave me advice to help my career. He told me that there was a producer who would contand that if I followed his advice he would make me famous again. Cale said I would star in the producer’s film and it would be a huge success.” “And did anyone contabout the film?” I asked. “Yes, it was just as he’d predicted. Two days later I got an email from a producer in Hollywood. He said that he had a part in a movie that was perfect for me.” “And did you meet with him to discuss the movie?” “No, we communicated by email. We got on so well because he understood that I was a serious actress. That’s why he was offering me the opportunity to invest.” There was pride in her voice. “Invest? Invest in what?” “In his movie, of course. He didn’t just want me to star. He wanted me to produce it with him. It’s so difficult to find investors in films nowadays, and with our combined talent he said we could make a fortune.” “Did you send him any money?” “Only the first payment. I was going to send more next week. But then Devlin Cale sent me another message and it frightened me.” “What did Cale’s message say?” “He said that people were trying to steal from me. He warned me that people were trying to harm me. The strange thing is that his voice was different this time. It was deeper and angrier.” I took a closer look at the painting that was hanging above her bed. It wasn’t one of Devlin Cale’s paintings. It was a portrait of Cora Ray when she was a young woman. I looked under the bed and inside cupboards without finding anything that would explain the voices. The obvious explanation was that Dr. Cross was right and Cora needed psychiatric help. I thought about the psychiatrist who would visit Cora in the morning. There were several pill bottles beside Cora’s bed. I checked them and noticed that she was taking some pretty strong medication. “Who gave you these, Cora?” I asked. “Dr. Cross, he’s so helpful. I have problems sleeping, you see.” I took a closer look at the bottles. They didn’t look like any sleeping pills I’d ever seen. We left Cora’s room and went back out to the corridor. “Who stays in the room next to you?” I asked. “No one. There are so many rooms in the house and we don’t use them all.” The room next to Cora’s bedroom was locked. I began checking the other rooms along the corridor; they were unlocked, but I found nothing of interest. It was late and I was exhausted. After a while I realized that Cora had disappeared. I went out to the corridor and saw her coming up the stairs. “I remembered that Carlyle has a special place for spare keys for all the rooms.” She held the key like a child who had found a present. Our excitement disappeared as soon as we unlocked the room. Inside, the few pieces of furniture were covered with white sheets and the curtains were closed. “Perhaps we should look downstairs?” Cora suggested. We were about to leave when I noticed that there was something strange about the wallpaper in the corner of the room. I stepped forward to get a closer look. There was an almost invisible line running along the wall from floor to ceiling. I knocked against the wall. It sounded hollow. It was a secret door, almost impossible to see unless a person knew it was there. There was no handle. I pushed my shoulder against it and heard the lock break. It revealed a secret space built into the wall between Cora Ray’s room and the room we were now in. On a small table there was recording equipment. I followed the wires, noticing where they disappeared into the wall. I hurried back to Cora’s room to follow where the wires came out. I discovered that they were connected to a tiny speaker, hidden behind the portrait of Cora Ray when she was a young actress. If someone put on a CD in the secret room, it would sound as though someone was speaking in Cora’s bedroom. When I went back, Cora was standing in the doorway, looking into the room. “I didn’t know this place existed,” she gasped. I picked up one of the CDs and played it. A deep, dramatic voice said, “Are you listening to me, Cora? I have some important information for you. You will be contacted about an opportunity to invest some money and become a star again.” Cora stepped back, looking frightened. “That was what Cale’s voice sounded like the first time he spoke to me. But, as I said, the last few times he communicated his voice has been quite different.” I rubbed my forehead. “The voice on this CD certainly isn’t Devlin Cale,” I said. “What’s the name of the producer who emailed you?” “Jim Lewenski.” Cora looked confused. “He’s a talented young American producer. I’ve seen some of his films.” I asked to look at her computer and checked the emails. Then I searched the Internet and found a number for Jim Lewenski in Hollywood. After checking the time difference, I made the call. Jim Lewenski’s secretary answered. She checked with her boss and told me that Mr. Lewenski had never agreed to make a film with Cora Ray and had no plans to work with her on any project. I watched Cora’s anxious face as I spoke on the phone, and for the first time I felt really sorry for her. She looked so hopeful, and then as she watched my face, she slowly realized that someone had been playing a cruel trick. Someone was using her vanity and pride to steal thousands of dollars from her. It had to be someone who knew places in this house that even its owner hadn’t yet discovered. “I’d like to speak to Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle,” I said. Guarding the Cales Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle were in their night clothes when they arrived. I showed them the secret room. “Did you know about this?” I asked. “This house is full of secrets. Mr. Cale liked his hidden rooms,” Mr. Carlyle said. “And how would you know that?” “My father worked for Devlin Cale.” I remembered the information on the website about Cale’s disappearance. “So, you’re Jerome Carlyle’s son? Your father was the last person to see Cale before he disappeared, wasn’t he?” Carlyle refused to answer. He narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms. “Look, I’m losing patience with this house of secrets. Tell us what happened when your father saw Cale for the last time.” I demanded. “Strangers like you have no business coming here asking questions.” He glared at me. Cora stepped forward. “But as Cale’s relative I do have the right to ask questions, Carlyle. Please, we need to know what happened in the past so that we can try to understand what’s happening now.” At first, it looked as though Carlyle would still refuse to speak. “For goodness sake, tell them.” His wife put her hand on his arm. When Carlyle eventually spoke, it sounded as though each word was an effort. “My father told me that the family of a young student named Leo Drake returned the painting to Mr. Cale. It was placed in his studio and he locked the door. He wouldn’t even let the servants inside to clean the place. One morning, my father saw Mr. Cale unlock the door and go into the studio, but he never came out again.” “What happened?” Cora asked quietly. “After a while, they went into the studio to search for Mr. Cale, but the room was empty. There was a burned mark on the floor in front of the painting, but there was no sign of Mr. Cale. My father noticed something else, too.” Carlyle looked at his hands as though embarrassed. “He said that after Mr. Cale went missing, a figure that looked like Cale appeared in the painting. My father was certain that the figure hadn’t been in the painting before.” “Maybe Cale painted it before he went missing?” I suggested, although I didn’t really believe it. “Perhaps. But both my mother and father were convinced that Mr. Cale had somehow become trapped inside the painting. They blamed it on his experiments; they didn’t know much about them because he was so secretive. But it was said he was trying to mix magic and painting. I know how mad it sounds, and that’s why my father hated to speak of it. Mr. Cale’s wife believed it, too. She didn’t want to destroy the painting so she hid it in the attic with a warning. It stayed there for years so that it couldn’t harm anyone else.” The room felt cold suddenly and I noticed Cora shiver. “Why didn’t you tell me this before?” she asked. “Would you have believed me, madam?” “Well, now that we’ve got you talking, Mr. Carlyle, can you tell us where you got the recording equipment?” I asked. “What recording equipment?” Carlyle looked puzzled. “Don’t play games. I’m talking about the recording equipment in this room. The same equipment that was used to convince Miss Ray that Devlin Cale wanted her to invest a large amount of money.” Carlyle shook his head. “Don’t you understand? My family has worked for the Cales for generations. My father made me promise to do everything possible to guard the Cale family. I worked all my life for Mr. Cale’s son and I’ll continue to work for Miss Ray as long as she needs me. I would never do anything to harm any member of the Cale family.” “Thank you, Mr. Carlyle. I believe you,” Cora said. I wasn’t so sure, but I had to admit that Carlyle was a pretty good actor if he was lying. She told the couple to go back to their house on the other side of the estate. Cora and I went downstairs and sat in the library. “Why did you leave the case, Mr. Winters?” Cora asked, taking a seat opposite me. “I didn’t leave. You fired me after you gave that interview to the press about your haunted painting. It’s difficult to know what to believe about you, Miss Ray.” “I can understand that, Mr. Winters. I’m an actress and I use events from my life to publicize my work. But it doesn’t mean that the events aren’t true. And there must be some misunderstanding: I never fired you.” I didn’t know what to believe. Something else was bothering me. “You said that Devlin Cale’s voice changed. When did that happen?” “In the last few days. As I said, it became deeper. But it also sounded further away. It’s difficult to explain. But his anger frightened me. He said that no one was permitted to disrespect the Cale family.” We heard footsteps in the hall. The door opened and Jessica hurried in. “Cora, what’s happened? Why aren’t you in bed?” she asked. “Where were you? I heard voices again and you weren’t here to help me. Thank goodness Mr. Winters called,” Cora said. “Are you OK, Mark? You look exhausted.” Jessica smiled at me. “A day in a police station can make you feel tired. I’ve been trying to conttoo. The police seem to have some crazy idea that I stole Cale’s painting.” Cora looked shocked. “Jessica, what’s this about the painting?” Jessica’s smile remained calm. “It’s nothing to worry about, Cora. There’s obviously been a misunderstanding. The police had a problem contacting me, Mark. I’m so sorry for all the trouble we’ve caused you. I’ll phone you tomorrow and explain. Perhaps you could let yourself out while I get Miss Ray back to bed.” “Where’s Dr. Cross?” I asked. “Visiting friends, I believe. He’ll be back tomorrow. Why do you ask?” There was a touch of irritation in Jessica’s voice. “I wanted to ask him a few questions about Miss Ray’s medication. Do you know why she’s on so many different types of pills?” “I wasn’t aware that you had an interest in medical matters,” Jessica said lightly. I’d noticed before that Jessica was good at avoiding questions. Suddenly I realized how little I really knew about her. “Come along, Miss Ray. It’s late and we should get you to bed. As you know, Miss Ray hasn’t been sleeping well,” Jessica said. “I know. She’s been hearing Devlin Cale’s voice. Tell me, do you think it’s a good idea for Cora to invest in Jim Lewenski’s movie?” I asked. Jessica shrugged. “Miss Ray’s business decisions are nothing to do with me.” “Who arranged for the money to be paid into Lewenski’s film project?” I asked. Cora looked from Jessica to me. “Jessica did, she’s excellent at organizing everything. What’s all this about, Mr. Winters?” I walked over and closed the door to the library. “Perhaps Jessica would like to answer that question for us,” I said. A change of plan Jessica stood looking at us. For a moment, I thought she was going to cry. “What exactly are you accusing me of, Mark?” “Yes, Mark. I demand to know what’s going on,” Cora said sharply. “I’m guessing you’re in charge of Miss Ray’s finances, aren’t you, Jessica? What happened? Did you start taking a little money at a time and then get greedy?” “This is ridiculous. How could you think that I could be capable of something like that?” Jessica asked quietly. I hesitated, wondering whether I was making a terrible mistake. Jessica was still looking at me, her brown eyes wide. Then she bowed her head and sighed. “I didn’t want to upset you, Cora, but Mr. Winters was at the house at midnight when Devlin Cale’s painting went missing. The police said that we should call immediately if he came here.” Cora looked as though she was on the point of collapse, and Jessica’s eyes glistened with tears. “I really think you should leave now, Mr. Winters,” Cora said, her voice shaking. I took a step toward the door and then hesitated and turned back. “Miss Ray, one last question. If you become ill or have to go into hospital, who would look after your money?” I asked. A look of irritation crossed Cora’s face. “Jessica would take care of it all. I arranged it with Doug before he died. I worry about my health, and Jessica is the only one capable of looking after my financial interests and the house for me.” “So if a psychiatrist signed papers to say that you had to go into hospital for a long period of time, Jessica would be in charge of everything.” “Mr. Winters, we have indulged your imagination enough for one evening. You really should go now,” Jessica said quietly. Her eyes were still glistening, but I could detect something harsher than sadness in them now. “What a bizarre question. Why would a psychiatrist make me go to the hospital?” Cora looked unsure whether to laugh at the idea. “Because Jessica has arranged with Dr. Cross to have a psychiatrist come to visit you tomorrow. My guess is that they will tell him about the voices that you hear and the strange things that you have been doing. With their evidence, it wouldn’t take much to convince him to sign papers to put you into the hospital for a while. Then when you eventually came out, I think you would find Jessica gone and your bank accounts empty.” “Jessica, tell him this isn’t true.” I walked over to the telephone. “I’m sure you have Dr. Cross’s number on speed dial, Cora. Why don’t we call him and ask him about the psychiatrist?” Jessica watched as I picked up the phone. “Put that down,” she said. “What’s wrong, Jessica? Dr. Cross can tell Cora that it isn’t true about the psychiatrist. He can prove your innocence.” “What’s going on? Jessica, what’s all this about a psychiatrist?” Cora asked. “It’s for your own good, Cora. It was all Dr. Cross’s idea.” “Really?” I pressed a button on the phone. “I’m sure Dr. Cross will be able to confirm that.” “I said put the phone down.” Jessica strode over and knocked it from my hand. She quickly picked the phone up from the floor and canceled the call. Cora was looking at Jessica with growing horror. “You don’t believe Mr. Winters, do you?” Jessica demanded. Cora held out her hand, “In that case, give me the phone and I’ll speak to Dr. Cross. We can soon see who is telling the truth.” The two women stared at each other. “I’m afraid I can’t let you do that, Miss Ray.” Jessica shook her head. “Oh, Jessica. It’s all true, isn’t it? I can tell by the look on your face.” Cora suddenly looked very frail. “What were you going to do?” “What do you mean?” Jessica asked. “When you got all the money you wanted from my bank account, what were you going to do?” For a moment it looked as though Jessica intended to deny the accusation again. But instead she shrugged, and it was as if a mask slipped from her face. “I was going to disappear. Which is exactly what I intend to do now.” She turned to glare at me. “This is all your fault. I never wanted Miss Ray to be upset like this.” “You don’t think it would have upset her to be locked away in a hospital while you stole her money?” I said. “You’ve taken up quite enough of my time, Mark. A lot of careful planning has been ruined through your interference.” Jessica took a step toward the door. I followed, but she turned quickly and pulled out a gun from her bag. “Stop right there,” she said. There was the sound of footsteps outside in the hall, and I hoped that Jessica hadn’t noticed. Suddenly, the door crashed open and Greg appeared in the doorway. “Be careful—she has a gun,” Cora warned him. Greg frowned at Jessica. “What are you doing?” he asked. He was close enough to touch her. She looked up at him and smiled. “I’m afraid there’s been a change of plan, darling,” she said. Escape in the night Cora sat down; her face had turned pale as she stared at her two employees. “Greg, you’re not working with her?” He wouldn’t look Cora in the eye. “Get the car ready, Greg. We need to leave,” Jessica ordered. “I was good to you. I treated you like my family.” There was anger in Cora’s voice. “No, you didn’t. We were always your servants,” Jessica replied, coldly. “Come on, Jessica. We have enough money in the bank account now. Let’s just go,” Greg said, looking uncomfortable. “No, get the money from the safe. Oh, and grab the Picasso and the Monet—they’re small enough to fit into the car; we’ll get a good price for them.” Jessica nodded to the paintings on the wall. She smiled at me. “The good news is that the police will finally believe that you didn’t have anything to do with stealing Devlin Cale’s painting. When I reported the theft to them, the painting was hidden in this room.” She smiled and pulled it from behind the sofa. “Please don’t take Cale’s painting, Jessica. Something terrible will happen to you if you do,” Cora pleaded. “I’m afraid I’ve become quite fond of it. As soon as you became convinced that the painting was to blame for Doug’s death, I realized how easy it would be to convince you that Devlin Cale was trying to communicate with you.” Jessica looked at her employer with something like affection. “Were you involved in Doug’s death, too?” Cora whispered. “No, of course not. It was an accident. It had nothing to do with me and nothing to do with the painting. You really shouldn’t be so superstitious, Cora. This might never have happened if you hadn’t started to believe that this stupid painting is haunted.” Jessica waved the gun at me. “Take it to the car,” she commanded. I admit that I didn’t want to touch the painting. It was like walking toward a snake. I felt that Devlin Cale’s eyes were watching me. “Cora’s right. You have everything you want. You have money and everything else you’ve stolen. Leave this painting here. It’s only brought misery to anyone connected to it.” “I’m disappointed in you, Mark. Didn’t you tell me that there is always a logical explanation?” she laughed. I tried to stall for time. “So, at first you tricked Cora into believing that Devlin Cale wanted her to invest in a fake movie project and paid the money into a fake account you’d set up. But soon you realized that you could steal a lot more if Cora was in hospital for a long period and you were in control of her finances. It must have been easy to get Greg under your spell. Did Dr. Cross help you, too?” “Only by being weak and stupid.” Jessica shook her head. “Did you know he was thrown out of medical school, Cora? Once I discovered that he wasn’t even a real doctor, I was able to get him to do whatever I wanted. All those pills he gave you made it easy for me to get you to believe anything. But no, he didn’t know about our little plan with the money. That’s why I couldn’t let you talk to him tonight. I can’t risk him suddenly trying to play the hero and getting the police involved.” She waved the gun at me again and nodded at Cale’s painting. “It’s time to go, Mark.” As I lifted the painting, it seemed hot and alive in my hands; it took all my strength not to throw it to the ground. She ordered Greg to tie up Cora and then followed me toward the drive and the waiting car. Her eyes never left me as I slid the painting into the back seat. “There’s a blanket on the floor, throw it over the picture,” she said. “It’s not too late, Jessica. Leave Cale’s painting here.” Touching the painting had left me with the certainty that it contained a powerful, dark force. “Stop pretending that you believe all this superstitious nonsense.” She looked at my expression and smiled. “Oh no, you’ve actually started to believe Cora’s crazy ideas, haven’t you? Well, thanks for worrying about me, Mark, but as you can see I can take care of myself.” She pushed the gun into my back and we went back toward the house. Greg had already tied Cora up by the time we returned to the room, and he pushed me into a chair next to her and tied me up, too. After Greg finished and left the room, Jessica bent down and whispered in my ear, “It really was very nice knowing you.” She kissed me on the cheek and left. Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle found us when they came to the house to fix breakfast. We phoned the police, and when they arrived we gave our statements. They immediately started a search for the couple and the car. When the police left, I said my good-byes to Cora. She had a kinder heart than I thought, because she surprised me by taking my hand and saying, “Don’t think too badly of Jessica, Mr. Winters. She was very kind to me, and it couldn’t all have been acting, could it?” I touched my cheek where Jessica’s lips had rested and wondered whether Cora was right. Sheila was waiting for me when I got back to the office. I’d already phoned her to explain what had happened. To my relief, she didn’t ask too many questions and she didn’t tell me to go home and rest. She knew me too well for that. Instead she made me coffee and sandwiches and handed me my mail. Our companionable silence was broken by the sound of the phone ringing, and Sheila answered it. “Mark Winters Paranormal Investigations,” she said. She listened to the voice on the other end of the line. “So you’d like Mr. Winters to investigate a haunted hotel? I’ll see if he’s available.” She looked across at me, one eyebrow raised. I shrugged a shoulder and nodded. “One moment, please. I’ll just put you through and we’ll see if Mr. Winters can help.” Sheila smiled. The final visit I returned to Falcon Lodge one final time. I was on my way back from visiting Harry Quinn at The Glades. He had recovered enough to beat me at chess, and we talked about the hotel case I was working on. He made it clear that he didn’t want to talk about Devlin Cale or the painting. On my way home, Mr. Carlyle phoned me to say that Cora was upset. They had found Jessica’s car and the police had arrested Greg. Greg told the police that Jessica had tricked him. They went to a petrol station and she told him to go and pay. As he walked back to the car, she started the engine. She waved at him from the window and drove off. The police found the car by a lake. They searched inside and discovered the paintings as well as money and jewels belonging to Cora. There was a small patch of burnt grass on the ground near the car. They never found Jessica. Cora said that in her heart she hopes that Jessica has found another life and has learned from her mistakes. Cora’s like that; she’s vain and sentimental, but she has a good heart. She’s still a little crazy, but I like her. The problem is that I know she’s wrong. I saw the painting one last time before Carlyle returned it to its place in the attic. Like her relatives before her, Cora couldn’t destroy the painting. She thought of it as a living thing that Devlin Cale and his victims would inhabit forever. Just before Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle carried it upstairs, we stood and looked at it. We were all very careful not to be alone with the painting, I noticed. I took one last look. First I glanced with pity at the attic window and saw the face of Leo Drake. I was about to turn away when another face caught my eye—one I had never noticed before. In the painted house a new face stared out from the shadows at the library window. It had soft brown eyes and long hair tied in a shiny ponytail. I stood up and turned away. “You can take it back to the attic now,” I said to Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle. “And make sure you put a strong lock on the door this time.” I kissed Cora Ray on the cheek and wished her luck. I would follow her career with interest, but I knew that I never wanted to return to Falcon Lodge again.

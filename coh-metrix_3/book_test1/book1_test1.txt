It’s getting late and Bobby’s trying to finish a paper for his class, but all he can think about is one thing: just where is his roommate Ash with the drinks? The store is just outside their building—the university dormitory where they both live. How long does it take to buy some soda? Ash is always slow, but 20 minutes? Bobby is just getting up to see where Ash is when there is a noise from outside their door. “Bobby, give me some help here,” Ash says from outside. “You didn’t lose your keys again, did you?” Bobby asks. “Come on.” Bobby opens the door and Ash goes by him into the room. He’s got a shopping bag in one hand, but he’s hiding something with the other. Ash has a strange look on his face that Bobby doesn’t like—the kind of look Ash gets when he’s making trouble. “It’s so cold out there!” Ash says. “What have you got there, Ash?” Bobby asks. “Promise me you won’t get angry.” “Oh, what now?” “It was outside the dorm,” Ash said. “It was all alone, Bobby. It needs our help.” “What are you talking about?” In answer, Ash sits on the floor and puts down a little kitten. It’s orange and white, and has a dirty face. It looks up at Bobby and meows. “What’s that?” Bobby asks. “It’s a cat,” Ash says. “Isn’t he great?” “I know it’s a cat. What’s it doing here?” “He’s just kind of sitting, I guess,” Ash says. “Is that so?” Bobby asks. “Ash, you know that’s not what I mean.” “Look at him,” Ash says. “He needs our help. Don’t you, little guy?” As if in reply, the cat meows. “See?” Ash says. “You need to get him out of here. You know nobody can have animals in here. We’ll get in trouble.” It was true for all the college buildings—no animals. “Nobody will know,” Ash says. “He was all alone outside. I think he needs some food.” “Get him out of here before Pete finds out.” “Pete won’t find out,” Ash says. “Ash, Pete’s our dorm manager. If he knows about this, he’ll have to throw us out,” Bobby says. “Let’s just give him something to eat.” “Ash . . .” “Tomorrow we can . . .” “No!” Bobby says. “I’m giving him something to eat,” Ash says. Bobby wants to say no, but he can see how much the cat needs to eat. Ash takes a can of tuna fish from the kitchen and starts to open it. The cat must be two or three weeks old, Bobby thinks. What kind of person leaves a little kitten out in the street? “Are you sure it’s OK, eating tuna fish?” Bobby asks as Ash puts the food down. “Why? Is there a problem?” Ash says. “I read something about it one time,” Bobby says, “about not giving cats too much salt.” Ash reads the can and says, “This’ll be OK.” They watch as the cat eats the food, meows, and then jumps onto Bobby’s bed. He starts to do something with his front paw, as if he’s digging for something. “What’s he doing?” Ash asks. “What are you doing, little guy?” In answer, the cat goes to the toilet on Bobby’s bed. “Oh, no!” Bobby says. “That’s it, Ash. He’s out of here. He’s out of here right now!” Ash takes the nearest towel and starts trying to clean up. “Hey, is that my towel?” Bobby asks him. “I’m sorry,” Ash says. “You can use mine.” “You’re just too much,” Bobby says. “I hope you know that.” With the little cat under his arm, Bobby goes down to the street. It’s the start of December and it’s cold. As he puts it down, the cat looks at Bobby as if it doesn’t understand. It starts to meow, over and over again. “Be quiet, will you?” Bobby says. “Come on now. Get out of here.” The cat doesn’t do anything. It just keeps on meowing and looking at Bobby. Go back in, Bobby, he says to himself. Go back in and don’t think about it. But he can’t. He picks up the cat. Ash is watching him from the door. “Just one night,” Bobby says. Bobby doesn’t like having a cat in the room. He doesn’t like it going to the toilet on his bed. He doesn’t like it sleeping on his bed. Most of all, he doesn’t like the trouble they’ll be in if Pete finds out. The next morning, Bobby makes Ash agree that the cat won’t be there when he gets back. Bobby writes some of his paper. Then, after class, he has his part-time job, so he is very tired when he finishes. It’s 10:30 by the time he gets back. As he opens the door, he thinks about the cat not being there and it makes him a little sad. But as he goes in, the first thing he sees is a little orange-and-white face looking up from his bed. “Ash?” Bobby says as he falls down on his bed next to the cat. “Don’t worry about a thing,” Ash tells him. There is a picture of the cat on his computer. “I put pictures of him on lots of websites. And I made some calls. Someone will take him, for sure.” “What if Pete comes?” “Pete?” says Ash. “Pete never comes.” Just then there is someone at the door. Ash and Bobby look at each other. “Who is it?” Ash says. “Hey, guys, it’s Pete.” “Just a minute,” Ash says. “What are we going to do?” Bobby says. “We have to hide him,” Ash says. “Quick!” Bobby takes the cat and puts him under the bed covers, then sits in front of him and starts reading a book. Ash opens the door. “Hey, guys,” Pete says. “Everything all right?” Ash is in front of him, stopping Pete from coming into the room. “Everything’s fine,” Ash says. “Hi, Pete,” says Bobby. “What’s that smell?” Pete says. “That’s cleaning stuff,” says Ash. “I got some cleaning stuff and it’s made everything smell bad. I’m going back to the store tomorrow.” “Hey, that’s not good,” says Pete. “Can I see it? I don’t want to buy the same one.” “I guess it’s in the trash now,” Ash says. “It smells like cats or something,” Pete says. Ash is still in front of him. “What can we do for you, Pete?” he asks. “Sorry, yes. Do you guys want to go to the game on Saturday?” “I don’t know, we’ve got a lot of work to do,” says Bobby. “Meow,” says the cat. “What was that?” asks Pete. “I don’t know,” says Bobby. “What was that?” “I don’t know,” Ash says. “Something on the computer?” “Oh,” said Pete. “It was like a cat.” “It was, wasn’t it?” Ash said. “Maybe it was the cleaning stuff!” Pete starts to laugh. “That’s a good one,” he says. “So what about it?” “What about what?” Ash asks. “The game this Saturday.” “It’s like Bobby says—we have too much work right now. Thanks for asking though, Pete.” “Thanks a lot,” says Bobby. “Well, I won’t keep you,” Pete says. “Are you sure you guys are all right?” “Sure, we’re all right,” says Ash. “See you later, Pete.” Pete looks like he’s about to say something more, but he goes back out. “See?” Ash says, smiling. “Nothing to worry about.” The next day, Bobby meets his friend Jenny in the Cascade Café and tells her about the cat. “I’d love to help you guys out,” Jenny says, “but my roommate doesn’t like cats, so . . .” “I understand,” Bobby says. “I just don’t know what to do. Ash says he’s going to find someone to take him today, but I don’t think he can do it.” Bobby’s phone makes a sound. It’s a text from Ash. What about Toby? I think that’s a good name for him, don’t you? ☺ “See what I mean?” Bobby says. “What a nice name!” Jenny says. “Come on.” “It’s so good of you guys to take care of him. I mean, you can get in so much trouble.” “Thanks,” Bobby says. “I guess.” “I mean, you can get kicked out and everything,” she says. “Jenny, I need your help here!” Jenny drinks her coffee and thinks about it. “What about Suki?” Jenny says. “She loves animals. Or Estela? Maybe they’ll take him. Hilary’s got a cat, too. Ask her.” “That’s a great idea,” Bobby says. “I’ll call them right now.” Bobby calls them all, one at a time, but they tell the same story as Jenny. Suki says her boyfriend, Kurt, hates cats. Estela says her apartment’s too small. Hilary says her cat, Maxie, won’t like it. Bobby asks all his friends, and everybody wants to help, but nobody does help. Only Chris says, “What about an animal shelter? There are lots of places that can look after animals. Maybe there’s one near here.” “Why didn’t I think of that?” Bobby says. “Of course!” He goes home to talk to Ash about it. When he gets in, Ash is teaching the cat how to use a toilet. “We don’t want to have any more problems,” Ash says. “Do we, Toby boy? No, we don’t. Hey, what do you think of the name Toby? It’s a good one, isn’t it?” “Did anyone call?” Bobby asks. “What about?” “About the picture you put on the websites,” Bobby says. “You’re trying to find him a new owner, right?” “Not yet. I’m sure they will though,” Ash says. “Why don’t we take him to an animal shelter?” Bobby says. “What kind of animal shelter?” Ash asks. “Somewhere that takes in animals without homes.” “Do they have any of those in Brenton?” Ash asks. “I don’t think they do.” “Could we have a look?” Bobby says. He turns on his computer. “Here,” he says, showing Ash a webpage for the Brenton Animal Shelter. “It says that they take in animals to help them find owners. It’s not open now, but we could take him down there tomorrow.” “I don’t know,” Ash says. He doesn’t look happy about it. “I don’t think he’ll be very happy there, do you?” “It’ll just be for a short time. They’ll find him a new home soon.” Ash is about to reply, but then there is someone at the door. Bobby hides Toby, and Ash opens the door to see Pete there with an angry look on his face. Before he can speak, Pete goes past him into the room. “I was thinking,” he says. “You don’t get cleaning stuff that smells like cats.” Before either of them can speak, Toby jumps down onto the floor and looks up at Pete. “Meow,” he says. “I’m not happy about this, guys,” Pete says. “I’m not happy about this at all.” “I’m sorry,” Ash says. “We’re sorry.” “We’re sorry,” Bobby says. He wants to say Toby is Ash’s, but he stops himself. Toby meows. “So this is it, huh?” Pete says. “It’s not an ‘it,’” Ash says. “It’s a ‘he.’” “He’s a good-looking cat,” Pete says. “I’ll say that for him.” “You see?” says Ash. “But you can’t keep him here,” Pete says. “You’re breaking the rules and you’ll get me in trouble.” “We’re taking him to a shelter tomorrow,” Bobby says. “I promise: he’ll be out of here tomorrow. There’s nothing we can do now apart from put him back on the street. You don’t want us to do that, do you?” “He shouldn’t be here,” Pete says. Ash doesn’t say anything—he just looks unhappy. “Please,” Bobby says. “Tomorrow morning I want him out,” says Pete, “or you two will be out as well.” “I guess that’s that, then,” Bobby says, but again Ash doesn’t reply. The shelter is about 30 minutes away. Bobby drives them there, Ash sitting in the back with Toby in an open sports bag. Ash talks to him all the way, and Toby meows back at him. Are we doing the right thing here? Bobby thinks, but then he remembers Pete. Yes, we are, he thinks. I hope. They arrive at an old building with “Brenton Animal Shelter” on the front. It doesn’t look too friendly. Bobby opens the door and the smell of animals hits him. There’s a man at a desk and in a room behind him are animals in cages: dogs, cats, everything together. There’s a lot of noise. In another room, some animals are out playing on the floor with a young woman. She smiles at them, but it’s not a happy smile, Bobby thinks. “Give me a second, will you?” Ash says. The three of them go back outside. Ash puts his hand on Toby’s head. There are tears in his eyes. “Goodbye, little guy,” he says. “You take care of yourself, all right?” Toby meows back at him. “Do you want me to do this?” Bobby asks. He’s never seen Ash like this. “Maybe that’s a good idea,” Ash says. Bobby takes the bag and goes inside. He says hello to the man, whose name is Luke. Bobby tells Luke about finding Toby. Luke listens and smiles in understanding. He says they can take Toby and starts to tell him the rules of the shelter. Bobby’s not really listening—he’s too worried about Ash, who seems so unhappy about it all. “. . . and we can only keep him for a week,” Luke says. “You understand what this means, right?” “Sure, sure,” Bobby says. He’s hoping Ash will be all right. “We’ll do our best to find a home for him, of course,” Luke goes on, “but you can see how busy we are.” “OK,” Bobby replies. “If you’re sure, write your name and phone number here,” Luke says, giving him a pen. Bobby writes his name down. “OK, that’s it,” Luke says. Bobby thanks him and goes back outside. Ash is sitting on the ground. “It’ll be all right,” he says to him, hoping it’s true. A week goes by, and Ash is still unhappy. Bobby tries to make him feel better and asks him to go out, but Ash says no, he just wants to stay home and study. Ash must be really unhappy, Bobby thinks, if he wants to study. Bobby’s not feeling good about it. It’s not the same without their little friend, but what can they do? It’s the last day of classes, and Bobby finally talks Ash into going out for something to eat with Jenny and Chris and some of their other friends. They meet at the Cascade Café. All their friends see how Ash, usually the happiest person in the room, is very quiet today. Bobby tells Jenny about Toby, but by the time he gets to telling them about the shelter, Jenny is looking angry. “A shelter?” Jenny says. “Is that a good idea?” “Sure, it’s a good idea,” Chris says. “I don’t understand,” Bobby says. “Why isn’t it a good idea?” “I don’t think shelters keep animals too long, Bobby,” Jenny says. “Ninety percent of them don’t.” Ash is listening carefully. He looks as if he doesn’t understand. Bobby feels hot, suddenly. “What do you mean?” Ash asks. “Just that most shelters try to find the animal a home for a short time—sometimes it’s a few days, sometimes a week or so—and if they don’t, well . . .” There is quiet around the table. “If they don’t . . . then what?” Bobby asks, beginning to understand. “Then they put them to sleep,” Jenny says. Ash’s face is white. He gets up. “Not all of them, though,” Jenny says. “Some shelters don’t do that. When you check an animal in, they should tell you their rules.” Ash turns to Bobby. “Bobby, you were in there with him. What were the rules?” It takes Bobby a few moments to remember, but when he does, he doesn’t want to say it. “One week.” Yesterday. “One week,” Bobby says very quietly. “The man says they’ll keep him one week.” Ash runs out of the door. Bobby and Jenny run after him. “Ash,” they shout. “Ash, I’ve got my car,” Jenny shouts. “We can go in my car.” Ash turns around. He’s got a look on his face that Bobby’s never seen before. “If he’s . . . If he’s . . .” Ash starts to say. “I know, I know,” Bobby says. “I don’t know what to say.” “One week was yesterday, Bobby,” Ash tells him. “Why didn’t you say?” “I don’t know,” Bobby says, and he doesn’t. How can I be so stupid? he thinks. They get in Jenny’s car and drive fast to the shelter. Nobody speaks on the way. Jenny pulls up outside the front door, and Ash and Bobby run inside. Luke is at the desk again. “Hi,” he says. “How can I help?” “A week ago,” Bobby says, “I was here with a little orange cat . . .” “Oh, I remember,” Luke says. “I don’t think anyone has him. It’s been a quiet week. Let me see.” He checks his papers. “Oh, yes. I’m sorry. It’s over a week now, so . . .” “Please check,” Ash says. “Now.” “Sure,” Luke says. “The doctor wasn’t in yesterday, so maybe he’s . . . still here. What are you saying? You want to take him back? Are you sure?” “Totally,” Ash says. He looks hard at Bobby. “I think so,” Bobby says. “I mean yes, we’re sure.” Luke goes into the back. As they wait, the look on Ash’s face is hard to see. More than anything, Bobby hopes Toby is OK. “Ash,” he says. “Don’t say anything, Bobby,” Ash says. “Really, just don’t.” A few minutes go by. It’s the longest few minutes of Bobby’s life. Then the doors open and Luke comes through, alone. Ash’s face is white, but then behind him comes the smiling woman from the play room with Toby in her arms. “Toby!” Ash shouts. He’s crying again, and Bobby’s surprised to find he is, too. “You know, I don’t know what’s going on here,” Luke says, “but having an animal is a big choice. Giving an animal away is a big choice. Do you understand what I’m telling you?” “I do,” Ash says. He takes Toby from the woman. The kitten meows back at him. “Me, too,” Bobby says. He thinks he does. They both go outside. Jenny is waiting for them. “Oh, he’s beautiful!” she says. “He is, isn’t he?” says Ash. “But what are you going to do?” Jenny asks. “You can’t keep him, can you?” “We can,” says Ash. “How?” asks Bobby. “We can find a new apartment,” says Ash. “Ash, I don’t have enough money for the room we’re in,” says Bobby. “I want to help, really I do. But I don’t have the money.” “I’ll get another job, too,” Ash says. “I’ll pay the extra. Anyway, it won’t be that much more. Aren’t you sick of living in that little room? I know I am.” “Ash,” says Bobby, “this is a big change you’re talking about. You want to do all this for a cat? I mean, he’s just a cat, right?” “That’s the problem, Bobby, right there. That’s why there are so many problems in the world. Because everything is too much trouble. This is a life we’re talking about. Toby may not be a person, he may be ‘just a cat,’ but he’s still a living thing. He’s got the right to live a happy life, doesn’t he?” “Are you really sure about this?” Jenny asks. “I am,” Ash says. “Will you do it, Bobby?” “What are we going to do for today though?” Bobby asks. “We can’t take him back to our room.” Ash doesn’t seem to have an answer for that, so he looks at Jenny. “Oh, all right,” Jenny says. “I’ll take him. Just until you find somewhere.” “Thanks, Jenny,” the two boys say, and they give her a hug. “What about you, Toby?” Jenny says. Toby meows. “Well, all right, then,” Bobby says. “Let’s go home.”

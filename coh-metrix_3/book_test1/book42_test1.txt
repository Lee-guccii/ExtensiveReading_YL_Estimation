The man in the park I was approaching Brompton Cemetery’s north gate when the man suddenly appeared. His legs were shaking as he walked out of the thick bushes and past the gravestones. He looked terrible, as if he had been sleeping on the streets for days; his clothes were dirty, his hair was a mess, and he badly needed a shave. It was half past seven in the morning, and I was hurrying to work. That meant I would have to walk past him; my bus stopped just beyond the gate. And I felt sure he was going to ask me for money. Normally, Brompton Cemetery is peaceful; the high walls keep out the noise of the London traffic. The park is huge, over forty acres, and covered in trees and bushes. Because there are no high buildings, it feels more like the country than the city; it’s full of birds and butterflies, and it’s common to see animals like squirrels and even foxes playing in the grass around the graves. There’s a small church in the middle and long paths leading to the gates in every corner. I could see that he was going to try to speak to me. As we came closer, I looked away and tried to walk around him. But before I could get past, the man fell into my arms. I couldn’t catch him properly; I had my briefcase in one hand and a large, plastic bag with Sarah’s birthday present in the other. It was a rose plant for her garden, and pink, her favorite color. Although she had ended our relationship two weeks before, I had bought her the rose anyway. I wasn’t sure if it was the right thing to give her, and I knew it wouldn’t make her change her mind. But after four years together, I had to get her something. The weight of the man’s body made me step back, but he held on to me tightly. He smelled of sweat. I noticed that his face was brown, probably from living outside through the summer, and there was something in his eyes that shocked me. He looked like he had just woken from a nightmare. “Please!” he said, and his voice was so weak it was like a sigh. “Help me!” Disgusted, I pushed him away. It wasn’t a hard push, but he fell and landed on his back on the grass beside the path. He was hardly moving. His hair was wet with sweat and he was trying to say something. I wanted to continue to the bus stop. I had to get to work— after all, there was a chance it would be the most important day of my career. But it was obvious that the man needed a doctor. I paused, wondering what to do. I was beginning to feel very uncomfortable. I looked around. A couple jogged slowly past listening to music. Up ahead, an old woman was walking her dog. One man wandered along the path, talking into his cell phone; another man with long black hair appeared from around a corner, beyond the bushes, walking away with a newspaper in his hand. The man was still lying on the ground. His lips were moving, but he was making no sound. I hesitated. My bus stop was less than thirty meters away, and I had no time to waste. But the man clearly needed help. Unwillingly, I started to bend down toward him. And then I saw my bus at the end of the street. If I missed that, it would be at least another ten minutes until the next one arrived. “I’m sorry,” I said, and I ran toward the bus stop, leaving the man lying on the grass. Besides, there were plenty of other people around. I didn’t really need to get involved. If the man needed help, I knew that someone else would soon find him. Within minutes, I was sitting on the bus and thinking again about the day’s big announcement. As I looked out the window at the busy streets of central London, I had already forgotten all about the man in the park. Waiting for the news “Here it is, everyone,” shouted David, our boss, as I ran into the building. “The Enquirer’s new TV studio!” We had been waiting for this moment for two months. I hurried to join the group at the studio door. At last we were going to discover exactly what our new roles would be. Ever since the new owner of The Enquirer newspaper, the super rich British businessman Sir James Boyd, had announced his decision to launch a live international TV news channel, we had been waiting for this announcement. I forced myself to breathe slowly. I was one of the favorites for the most important job: principal news presenter. Whoever got it would become one of the most important people in the industry. It meant security, a great income and, perhaps most importantly, far more editorial control. “Before I announce your new positions,” said David with a smile, “let me show you around your new work place. As you can see, the studio is a very good size, and very adaptable. There’s space for an audience of one hundred and twenty . . .” That was typical of David. He knew we all wanted to hear the announcement. But he liked to keep secrets to himself for as long as possible. We had no choice but to follow him around the studio. “As you would expect,” he said, stepping up onto the stage, “the lighting can be used in many different ways. It can light up the displays, and can automatically follow the presenters around the stage . . .” As David spoke, I noticed Sarah standing opposite. Four years ago, when we first met, she was a researcher, and one of the best. Now she was likely to be The Enquirer’s new TV producer. And although she was officially no longer my girlfriend, as I looked at her I couldn’t help feeling proud. Because it was her birthday as well as the day of the big announcement, she had obviously made an effort to look nice. Her long, brown hair was pulled back off her face with a ribbon, and she was wearing a stylish suit that I didn’t recognize. She looked good. But then she always looked good. “Behind the presenters,” said David, still talking, “are floor-to-ceiling screens for showing the usual films or charts. They’re the best that money can buy, and show beautifully clear pictures . . .” I tried to concentrate on David’s tour. After years of hard work, I was desperate for the presenter job. As far as I knew, there was only one other person being considered, a journalist at a different newspaper. So for the last two months I had done all I could to prove to Sir James that I was the best person. Once I’d gotten the job, then I’d do whatever was necessary to win Sarah back. But for just one more day, I had to focus on work. I couldn’t let my attention wander to other things. Somehow I had to ignore the rush of feeling every time I saw her. I had to be professional. “These cameras,” David continued, pointing at the three machines standing ready by the stage, “are the best that money can buy. They can be operated traditionally, by a cameraman, or remotely from the control room. And whatever you see on their screen is automatically recorded to the hard drive of the computer. That means that all material is instantly available for editing.” “Automatic recording to hard drive,” Sarah commented. “That’s new!” David turned to a large computer beside the stage. “The processors in this machine are amazing! They’re very, very powerful. They not only allow us to present our stories exactly the way we want them, but they can also control every inch of this space, from security access to studio temperature.” “Right,” said David, turning to face us again. My heart jumped. At last, I thought he was going to announce our new roles. Instead, he just pointed to the back of the studio. “Let’s go and see the place from where we control this computer—my favorite part! Follow me!” The control room would be David’s new office. The door was thick and, like the walls, was covered in material to soften the sound of his voice. He had to be able to give orders without disturbing the recording on stage. As I approached to follow David inside, I found myself beside Sarah. I stepped back to let her go through the door first. At the same time, she stepped back for me. “After you,” I said. “Thanks,” she smiled, and walked through the door, leaving the smell of her perfume behind her. And though her smile had been warm and friendly, I felt a brief moment of bitterness. Because, although for years we had shared everything, we were now suddenly acting formally, as if we didn’t know each other. I still loved her but, despite the fshe said we would remain friends, she had made us into strangers. In fact, we were worse than strangers; we were uncomfortable in each other’s company. David was still talking. “That’s for the sound engineering,” he said, pointing through a window to another, smaller room next door. “And this,” he sat down on a big black chair with a happy smile, “is where I will be sitting.” We all stood in silence around his big chair, waiting. “OK,” he laughed, enjoying his secret. “I’ll tell you what I know. Mike,” David pointed at one of the guys beside me. “You’re going to be helping me in here as assistant editor. Congratulations!” Mike smiled. A few people clapped. “Francesca?” A senior engineer stepped forward. “You’re in charge of the sound.” “Thanks, David!” said Francesca, obviously delighted. “Thank Sir James; I just make recommendations. Derek?” For the next few minutes, David went round the group and revealed everyone’s roles. At last there was just me and Sarah left. “Sarah?” smiled David. “Happy Birthday! You’re senior producer.” Everyone else cheered, but I was too nervous to speak. Had Sir James chosen me? Or the other journalist? Everyone was now waiting to hear the answer, and watching for my reaction. “Now,” said David, “that just leaves the main presenter role. And I know you’ll all be anxious to hear about that, especially you, Pete. But I’m sorry to say that Sir James hasn’t decided yet.” “What?” I shouted. I couldn’t stop myself. “I’m sorry, Pete. I’ll let you know as soon as I hear anything. And don’t worry; even if he decides you’re not right for this particular job, you’ll still have a place here as senior reporter. OK, everyone,” he turned to the rest of the room. “Feel free to have a look around, familiarize yourselves with your new equipment . . .” Slowly, everyone left the control room. No one looked at me. I knew that they were all thinking the same: if Sir James had chosen me, he would surely have told me by now. Through the thick glass window separating the control room from the studio, I could see that everyone was busy. Sarah was inspecting the stage and all the machines. As senior producer, she would have to know everything about the studio to make sure it worked smoothly. I turned to our boss. “David?” “I’m sorry, Pete,” he answered immediately. “Like I said, I’ll let you know as soon as I know.” “But we launch tomorrow!” David smiled. “I think we’re all aware of that.” “It doesn’t look good for me, does it? Has Sir James give the job to that other guy, the one from KPG News?” “I really don’t know, Pete. You have to hold on just a little longer. I’m sure Sir James will make the right decision. You deserve it more than anyone.” He turned back to the desk and pressed a button. “OK, everyone,” he said, and his words rang around the studio. “When you’ve had a good look, it’s back to work.” I looked up at the row of screens on the control room wall. If I did get the job, it would be my face on all of them. I would be one of the most famous people in London. And people all around the world would turn on their televisions and look to me for all the important information on which they based their lives. “How are you feeling?” I turned. The room was now empty except for Sarah. She was standing by the door, as if she was unwilling to step into the room. “Fine,” I answered. But of course she knew I was lying. She knew how desperately I wanted the presenter job. That was one of the reasons why she had ended our relationship. “You want that job too much,” she had said when she broke up with me. “You care more about your career than the truth behind your reports.” Of course, I had denied it. I had told her she wasn’t being fair. But she was insistent. “You’ve changed,” she had told me. “You’re no longer the man I loved.” It was a terrible accusation, and I couldn’t understand it. I had thought that we were perfect together. I had thought we shared the same goals. Obviously I was very wrong. But as I looked at her now, standing by the control room door, I saw a look of genuine sympathy on her face. “What did David say?” she asked, and her voice was kind and understanding. I sighed. “Just that I have to keep waiting.” “He’s right. Sir James has got all day to make his decision. He could still choose you. Don’t give up yet.” I tried to smile. “Thanks. And Happy Birthday, by the way!” I stepped forward to kiss her on the cheek and saw her hesitate, just for a second. Then, more relaxed, she turned her face toward me. It felt strange to be kissing her just as a friend. “I’ve got a present for you,” I said. “It’s on my desk.” “Thank you.” Just at that moment, Francesca walked past. “Happy Birthday!” she said, seeing Sarah. “What time are we meeting tonight?” Sarah looked at me quickly, then back at Francesca. “Eight o’clock.” “Great!” nodded Francesca. “See you then!” There was a short and uncomfortable silence. I recognized the look on Sarah’s face. She was making up her mind about something. “Look, Pete,” she said at last, “it will just be a few of us from work. But do you want to join us? I didn’t ask you before because, to be honest, I wasn’t sure if you’d want to come . . .” “Of course, I’d love to come,” I interrupted. Again, I was lying. I didn’t really want to go out with everyone else. I would have to pretend that we were both just good friends, and that everything was OK between us. And yet I did still want to be a part of her life. If she was celebrating something like a birthday, I wanted to be there with her. Again, of course, Sarah noticed my lie. “Well, if you decide to come, we’ll be at Lazio’s. But you don’t have to . . .” “Lazio’s?” I said, surprised. “Yes.” I paused. Lazio’s was her favorite restaurant. We had dined there together many times, just the two of us. Sarah must have known what I was thinking. “I’m sorry, Pete. Maybe that was insensitive. You don’t have to come if . . .” “Don’t worry,” I interrupted. I forced a smile. “It’s a good restaurant. You like it. So it’s the perfect place . . .” “It’s just that I’ve booked a table and there’s . . .” “. . . the food’s good . . .” “. . . just a small group of us and it’s . . .” “. . . great atmosphere.” “. . . not far from my flat.” We both stopped talking at the same time, and stared across the control room in another uncomfortable silence. The situation was looking impossible. With the way things were, whether I got the presenter job or not, how would we ever be able to work together again? Just then, David shouted from the newsroom next door. We hurried through. “Listen, everyone!” he was saying. “I’ve just heard: the oil protest in Parliament Square is much bigger than expected. There are thousands of people there, so I want one of us down there now!” “I’ll go!” I said quickly. It would be my last opportunity to prove myself to Sir James. But David hadn’t finished. “We’ll make this our lead story in the evening edition,” added David, “so let’s have the interview on tape. You should take someone with you. Sarah, will you go with Pete?” The interview “Sixty-eight pounds, twice a week!” a man shouted. “That’s over five hundred pounds every month just to fill my van with petrol! And my customers aren’t going to pay the extra. I can’t afford to keep working!” Sarah and I were pushing our way through the crowds of central London. The streets leading to Parliament Square were full of people. No vehicles could get through; even Westminster Bridge was closed to traffic. “My husband’s not well,” an old woman called out. “He needs to keep warm, but it’s too expensive to heat our home.” The name of our newspaper on the side of my briefcase made it clear that I was a reporter, so everyone wanted to talk to me. “High oil prices mean high food prices,” shouted a woman. “I can’t afford to feed my family.” “And what about the people running the petrol companies?” called a young man. “Every year, they get richer and richer because we have to pay more and more!” “What do you think?” shouted Sarah, over the noise. “We should interview some of these people.” I continued to push through the crowd. “I want to find someone in the Government who’ll talk to us,” I shouted back. “But we should interview some of these people!” called Sarah, following me. “They’re the victims of this story!” “We’ll get a few members of the public later,” I told her. “Let’s start with the people who create policy.” At last, using my case to push a path through the crowd, we reached the enormous fence surrounding the Houses of Parliament, beside the security gate. I stood up on the concrete base of the fence, and was able to look around. “Half the country must be here!” I called down to Sarah. And then I saw someone I knew walking out of the Parliament building. “Look!” I pointed. “That’s Gordon Macleod.” I pointed to where the man was walking toward a smart, black car. A driver was holding the rear door open. “He’s in charge of the Department of Trade. He’d give a great interview. Mr. Macleod?” I called through the fence. “Mr. Macleod?” Gordon Macleod looked up and saw me. But then he just ignored me. He climbed into the back of his car and, with help from the police, it slowly drove away through the crowds. I was annoyed, and was wishing that I already had that presenter job. Then everyone would have been happy to talk to me. I turned to see that Sarah was closing her cell phone. “That was David,” she said. “He’s arranged a meeting for us on College Green with Dr. Edward Mawle. He’s an official in the Department of Energy.” “I know who he is,” I said. I was impressed. “Dr. Mawle doesn’t usually give interviews.” “He’s not going to talk to anyone else. And David needs the report by six o’clock if he’s going to get it into the evening edition.” I looked at my watch. “That gives us ninety minutes. Let’s get going!” “Shouldn’t we speak to these people while we’re here?” “We don’t have time now. We’ll come back later.” College Green is at the south end of the Houses of Parliament, on Abingdon Street. By the time we got there, Dr. Mawle was already waiting at the edge of the crowd. “Dr. Mawle. I’m Pete Booker, from The Enquirer.” The man shook my hand. “I’m afraid I’ve only got a few minutes.” “Then we’ll get started.” I pulled out my digital recorder and began the interview. “Dr. Mawle, oil prices have reached a record high. All over the country, people are struggling. What is the Government’s response?” “Energy efficiency is the key; we’re asking the public to improve their homes and vehicles so that they use less oil. And we’re encouraging businesses and industry to invest in alternative power sources. We need to decrease this country’s dependence on foreign supply.” “That’s clear. But many would argue that you should be doing these things anyway. What’s your specific response to this crisis?” “This country has a good relationship with many oil-producing countries around the world,” answered Dr. Mawle. “They have agreed to provide us with oil for a good price. And we’re holding emergency talks with many more countries. We’re trying to agree on even better prices for the future.” “But what about the present? What about the people who can’t afford to heat their homes or feed their families today?” “I mentioned the measures we’re taking to encourage energy efficiency . . .” “What about tax cuts?” I interrupted. “Far more than half of what the public pays for petrol in the UK goes straight to the Government! Why can you not do what other governments around the world are doing, and reduce taxes?” “Unfortunately it’s not that simple. It’s the job of Government to balance a wide variety of responsibilities. But the people of this country have a responsibility too. Cutting taxes is not a practical solution; the answer lies in reducing oil consumption. And that’s something that we all need to work on together, as a nation. This is an opportunity to work toward a better, more environmental future. The world is changing, and we must change with it.” Dr. Mawle looked at his watch. “And now, Mr. Booker, I’m afraid I have to go.” “Well done,” said Sarah, as Dr. Mawle left. “He gave us some good quotes. Although I don’t think these protesters would be happy with his answers.” “I think you’re right,” I said, looking for my briefcase. “We’re almost done here. You can go, if you want. I’ll see you at Lazio’s later.” “OK,” she smiled. “And you’ll speak to the protesters?” I nodded. “Have you got my briefcase?” “No.” “But it was here, on the ground beside me!” I couldn’t see it anywhere. “Someone must have taken it!” “There are too many people here. You’ll never find it now. Was there anything important in it?” “Not really. And I suppose it’s a small price to pay for that interview. I wonder how David arranged it?” “I think he said that Dr. Mawle is a cousin of Sir James Boyd,” said Sarah. “A cousin?” “Yeah.” She waved good-bye. “See you at the restaurant!” Before I could reply, she had disappeared into the crowd. I watched her go, thinking carefully. The beginning of the end? It was nearer half past eight by the time I got out of the newsroom and arrived at Lazio’s. I wasn’t looking forward to the evening. But I was determined to at least look like I was enjoying it. And Sarah still had to open her present. In the rush for Parliament Square, she’d left it behind. As I hurried into the restaurant, I could see her sitting with the others around one of the larger tables. They already had their food and were enjoying their dinner. “Sorry I’m late,” I called across the table. Sarah’s smile disappeared the moment she heard me. Conversation around the table died. She wiped her mouth with a napkin, and then stood up to walk around toward me. Instantly, I thought I understood. Sarah looked unhappy because I hadn’t got the job. My heart sank. “Sir James has chosen that other guy to present the channel, hasn’t he?” But Sarah didn’t answer. “Come here,” she said quietly, and led me away from the table. “What is it?” I asked nervously. “Tell me! I need to know.” “It’s not about the job, Pete. I just need to ask you something.” “What?” Sarah paused. She looked uncomfortable, as if she didn’t know how to start. “I saw your report on the oil crisis.” “Yes?” “You didn’t speak to any of the protesters.” “There wasn’t enough time. David needed the story for the evening edition.” She nodded slightly, biting her lip. “And so you reported everything Dr. Mawle said. You didn’t challenge a single word.” I looked behind her at the table. Everyone was sitting in silence, pretending not to listen. “Why are we discussing this now?” I smiled, trying to change the subject. “It’s your birthday! We shouldn’t be talking about work.” “This is important, Pete,” said Sarah, quietly. “Think about it. Our names are on that paper as well. We’re all proud of The Enquirer. It’s famous around the world for balanced reporting. And I’m sorry to say it, but your report read like an advert for the Government.” That just made me angry. “If it was such a terrible report, it wouldn’t be on the front page! David would never have approved it.” Although her voice was still quiet, Sarah’s reply was fast. “Perhaps David is as eager to please Sir James as you are.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” She sighed. “It’s obvious why you didn’t speak to the protesters, Pete. It’s because I made the mistake of telling you that Dr. Mawle is Sir James’s cousin.” I took a deep breath. “Look, I don’t want to argue with you, Sarah. Let’s just forget about the story. Let’s just enjoy the evening. We can talk about this tomorrow, if you want. It’s just one story. Don’t . . .” “But it’s not just one story! It was the same last autumn, when we reported on those countryside floods. Hundreds of people lost their homes, and instead of really listening to them, you only talked to the local politicians—the supposedly important people.” “We talked about that, Sarah. Reporters need to make good contacts.” “Not at the expense of the truth!” “Let’s not go through this again. Can’t we just enjoy . . .” “You’re right,” she interrupted. “This isn’t the time or the place to talk about this. I’m sorry, but I think it would be better if you leave.” “Sarah, please, it’s your birthday! I want to celebrate with you.” “I made a mistake inviting you tonight. Why don’t we just forget about this? I’ll see you in the office tomorrow.” Everyone was looking at me, waiting for me to leave. There was nothing I could do. Sarah just didn’t understand. She seemed to think that ambition was a bad thing. But in any organization, it’s the people at the top who can make the most difference. If I could get the news presenter job, I would have security and greater control over my own future. And I would be able to offer all the benefits of that to her. Slowly, I turned toward the door. I was miserable as I walked home that evening. And I was halfway back to my flat before I realized I was still holding the bag with Sarah’s rose. I’d carried it half way across London for nothing. I threw it angrily into a public rubbish bin on the pavement. Not long after, I stepped out of the lift onto the fourth floor of my building. I couldn’t escape the image in my mind of Sarah standing in Lazio’s, angry and disappointed. But seconds later, in the instant that I opened my front door, I forgot all about her. Even in the dark, I could see that the place was a mess. All my belongings had been thrown on the floor. Pictures had been torn off the wall. I thought someone must have broken into my flat and robbed me. I was about to reach for my phone when I noticed, on the coffee table, my briefcase—the bag I had lost in Parliament Square! I couldn’t understand how it had gotten there. Puzzled, I turned on the light. And then I froze. Because sitting in my armchair in the shadows beyond the table was a man with a gun. No escape “Shut the door!” The man’s voice was deep and rough. I did as he said. “Put your hands up and step forward to the table.” “What do you want?” I managed to ask. “Do as I say, and don’t ask questions, or I’ll put a bullet in your stomach.” I could feel my legs getting weaker, but I stepped forward. “Now take off your coat. And throw it on the floor beside me.” I watched as the man picked up my coat and searched the pockets. Did he think I had a gun? He found nothing but my cell phone. “Empty your pockets.” “I don’t have . . .” “Empty your pockets!” he interrupted. I emptied out my pockets onto the table: my keys, wallet, and a stick of gum. “Where’s the tape?” said the man. “What?” “The tape. I know you have it. Where is it?” “I don’t know what you’re . . .” “Don’t lie to me,” the man said. His voice was so calm it was frightening. Slowly, he stood up, keeping the gun pointing at me. “Where is it?” “Honestly,” I said, and I could hear my voice shaking, “I don’t know what you mean. You’ve made a mistake. If it’s money you want, I’ve . . .” “Either you can tell me where the tape is,” said the man, raising his arm to point the gun at my head. “Or I can shoot you and continue to look for it myself.” He was standing in the light now, and I could see him more clearly. He was in his thirties and had long black hair. For a moment, I thought I had seen him somewhere before. His eyes looked determined and dangerous. I believed that he would shoot me without a thought. “OK!” I said. “Wait!” I was thinking quickly. “I know where the tape is. But it’s not here.” Of course, I had no idea what he was talking about, but I had to pretend that I did. It seemed the only way to stop him killing me immediately. “Where is it?” he said, threatening me still with the gun. “Downstairs,” I lied. “It’s downstairs. In the basement. In my locker in the basement.” “And have you made any copies?” “No.” That seemed to be the right answer. “Good,” he smiled. “Take me downstairs.” Slowly, I turned toward the door. “You go first,” he said. “And remember, I can shoot you and disappear before anyone knows I’m here.” I walked back into the hall and pressed the button for the lift. The man stood just behind me; because we were going out of the flat, he had hidden the gun in his belt, under his jacket. I didn’t know what I was going to do. When he realized there was no tape in the basement, he could kill me just as easily. “Get in,” ordered the man when the lift doors opened. His hand never left his side, only inches from his belt. Slowly, I stepped inside. “Press the button for the ground floor,” he said, following me in. I knew what he was thinking; he didn’t want to take his eyes off me to press the button himself. To reach, I had to step in front of him again, nearer the door. I pressed the button and waited, without moving. Perhaps he thought I would try to jump out the lift at the last second as the doors closed, because he stepped up close behind me. That gave me an idea. It was a desperate and very risky idea, and probably very stupid. But I didn’t have a choice. I felt sure that the man was going to shoot me whatever happened, in my flat or in the basement. So, as the doors started to move, instead of jumping forward, I suddenly threw myself backwards. I knocked into the man with the gun with my full weight. I felt him begin to fall. From the corner of my eye, I saw him reach out to stop himself falling over. And then, just as the doors were closing, I jumped forward and through. I knew that he would be only seconds behind me, but I didn’t stop to look. As I ran toward the stairs, I could hear him pulling the lift doors open again. And then he was running after me. I could imagine him just behind me with the gun in his hand. As I flew down the stairs, I expected to feel a bullet in my back at any moment. Our footsteps were loud in the small space. I threw myself round every corner, desperate to be out of his line of fire. I was out of control, and could easily have fallen, but it didn’t matter. I had nothing to lose. Within a few seconds, I had reached the ground floor. The hall was empty. As the sound of the gunman came closer, I charged out the front door. Without stopping to look around, I ran up the street, terrified, and turned down the first corner I could find. I knew the gunman was only seconds behind me. Why me? It was about ten o’clock at night. The street was empty. My cell phone was still lying on the table upstairs; I had to find another phone. I had to call the police. I ran toward a row of shops a few streets away: some restaurants, cafés, and a newsagent. They would be open soon, and I knew I’d find a phone there. Up ahead, I could see two men walking toward me through the street light. They were talking and joking. Perhaps they were returning from a night out. I ran toward them. “Please!” I cried. “Please! Someone’s chasing me.” “What?” said one of the men. He was smiling, as if he thought I was joking. I grabbed him by the coat. “Help me!” I begged. “He’s trying to kill me!” The man started laughing. “What are you talking about?” “He’s got a gun. He’s trying to kill me. Please, help!” “That’s enough,” said the other man, trying to push me away. “That’s not funny.” “You don’t understand! Someone is trying to kill me!” “Let go of me!” said the first man. He seemed scared and angry. “Get off!” With a big push, the two of them knocked me backwards onto the pavement. “Let’s get out of here!” one of them said, and they began to run away. “Please!” I shouted. “Call the police!” But they didn’t stop. As I sat on the ground, I watched them cross the road and turn out of sight. And then, at the far end of the street, the gunman appeared. He must have heard the shouting. He began running toward me. In desperation, I got to my feet and continued to run. I thought I’d be hit by a bullet at any second. Soon I turned a corner and was outside the row of shops. The first, a restaurant, seemed too obvious. The second was closed. I ran on, past another few restaurants, a wine shop, and a newsagents with newspapers outside. Near the end of the row was a café. With a quick look behind me, I stepped inside. The place was busy, which was good. Lots of people were sitting at tables or standing by the counter. I walked quickly to the back of the café and sat down at an empty table. There was a newspaper beside me; I picked it up to hide behind. I pretended to read. But really I was looking carefully across the café and out of the window. Only seconds later, the gunman appeared on the pavement outside. I could see him looking around. He was wondering if I had gone into one of the shops, or had continued running. He turned one way and then the other, undecided. I was terrified. The sweat was pouring down my face. If he came inside the café, I would be trapped, with nowhere to go. At last, the man walked away and disappeared from my sight. Still I waited. Perhaps it was a trick? Perhaps he was waiting on the street for me to reappear. For what seemed like half an hour, I sat at that table, pretending to read the newspaper. Fortunately the café was so busy that none of the waiters bothered me. At last, when I thought the gunman must have left, I began to look around. I was certain there would be a phone somewhere in the café. I wouldn’t need to go outside at all; I could call the police and wait for them there. I would be safe! I was just going to ask one of the waiters for the phone when my eye was caught by a story in the newspaper. It was about a dead body found in Brompton Cemetery. And there was a photo—of the man I had pushed away just that morning! Increasingly amazed, I read the article. “The body of Kevin Brown, 34, was discovered just before nine o’clock this morning. He had been shot in the back. Mr. Brown was a journalist. According to his employers at ADC News, he had recently returned from Africa. Police suspect his murder was related to drugs; just over four hundred pounds’ worth of illegal drugs were found on his body. Witnesses are asked to contpolice.” It was only then that I realized. The man chasing me with the gun—I did recognize him! I’d seen him in the cemetery that morning; he was the one with the long hair. He had appeared from behind the same bushes and watched as Kevin Brown fell into my arms! Suddenly, it was clear. Kevin Brown was killed because of the tape! Maybe he had filmed something secret about the drug world. Maybe that’s what he was investigating in Africa. And whatever secret Kevin had uncovered, the man with the gun had killed him to keep it quiet. And now that same man with the gun thought that I had the tape! My mind was working very fast. He must have thought that Kevin gave it to me in the cemetery before he died. The gunman wanted it back, and he was willing to kill me to get it! As I sat there in the café, I knew that I had a choice. I could call the police and tell them everything. Or I could try to find the tape first and discover its secret. If it was a secret worth killing for, I knew that it would make a big news story. And if I could get it to Sir James in time, it would be the sort of story that would make sure I got the presenter job. And there was no real risk now—if I stayed away from my flat, the gunman would never find me. When I’d sent in my story, then I could go to the police. I had made up my mind. Now I just had to find the tape. The truth Was it possible that I did actually have the tape? If Kevin Brown was carrying it in the cemetery, he might have dropped it on the ground. Or he might have slipped it into one of my pockets without me knowing. But the gunman must have checked the cemetery already. And he had made me empty my pockets. Then I remembered my briefcase. Perhaps the gunman stole it from Parliament Square because he thought the tape was inside? But obviously it wasn’t. So where could it be? And then I realized. If the tape wasn’t in my pockets and wasn’t in my briefcase, there was only one other place it could be: the plastic bag with Sarah’s rose! I was calmer now. And I was thinking more clearly. Within minutes, I had found a back door to the café and was several streets away. I was confident that I had escaped the gunman. And only ten minutes later, I was standing in the same dark street where I had thrown away Sarah’s present. The rubbish bin was full to the top. Without thinking, I began to dig hurriedly with my bare hands. I emptied the contents onto the pavement. It was past eleven o’clock at night, but there were still a few people around. A man walked by and saw me. With a look of disgust, he crossed the street. I kept digging. I threw out old cigarettes, dirty tissues, and empty bottles. I picked through newspapers and magazines, old pieces of fruit, and half-touched sandwiches. I was beginning to think that I was looking in the wrong bin. And then, at last, I found the plastic bag. Excited, I opened it. And inside, hidden at the bottom amongst the leaves of the rose plant, was a small digital tape! But where could I watch it? It wasn’t safe to go to the studio—there might have been others waiting for me there. And I couldn’t go home. I thought about calling Sarah. Despite our argument, I was sure that she would help if I asked. After all, she was as hungry for a good story as I was. But it was my story! I didn’t want to share it yet. There was only one place I could think of: Tottenham Court Road. The street is in the West End of London, near all the theaters. It’s full of electrical shops that sell computers, video cameras and recorders, DVD players, and televisions. And many of the shops are open almost twenty-four hours a day. If I could find a shop that was still open, I could probably find a machine that could play the tape. My wallet was with my cell phone, on the coffee table in my flat, so I had no money for a bus. It took me forty minutes to walk to the West End. “Can I help you, sir?” asked a man when I stepped into the first open shop. “I’m interested in your digital cameras,” I told him. I was pretending to be a normal customer. “Then you’ve come to the right place!” the man smiled. “Over here, sir.” I followed him to the back of the shop where there was a long line of cameras on display. “Do you have any particular function or price in mind?” he asked. “Not really.” “Then why don’t you start with the best?” He pointed to one of the machines. “This is the most advanced camera we have at the moment. Professional quality.” “Do you mind if I try it?” “Of course not, sir. You can see that it’s attached with a wire to the counter, so you won’t be able to move far. But try it. If you have any questions, I’ll be at my desk.” “Thank you.” The man returned to the front of the shop. I found the button to open the camera, and the tape fit perfectly. I had to guess how to operate it, but, at last, a picture appeared on the little screen. In case the shopkeeper returned, I lifted the camera to my eye. I was pretending to trial it. But really I was watching what was on the tape. It showed a countryside that was half desert. All around were dead trees and sand. “This is Mapula,” said a man’s voice. “A region of Bonande, on the west coast of Africa.” The picture showed more of the surrounding land. “For years, the minority people of Mapula have sought independence from Bonande. But the Bonandan Government refuses to give up control, and has sent soldiers into the Mapulan countryside. And those soldiers are killing everyone without pity.” I was puzzled. I had been expecting something about drugs. But this seemed to be about something very different. The picture now showed a remote African village. The huts were very primitive and made of mud. All around, dead bodies were spread across the ground. “This is just one of many, many similar villages all over Mapula,” continued the voice. “No one has been left alive. Men, women, children, the sick and the elderly—they’ve all been shot, murdered, by well-armed Bonandan soldiers.” The sight of so many dead people was horrible. The dry, dusty earth was red with blood. “With no arms manufacturers in this country, the United Nations has tried to stop the killing. It’s now illegal for anyone to sell guns to Bonande. So the question is this: where are the guns coming from?” Suddenly the picture showed a dusty gun lying in the dirt. “This is an AK-47, a very common, and very deadly, weapon. This particular one is broken. A Bonandan soldier has thrown it away because it’s not worth fixing. There are so many AK-47s in this country that a new one costs just thirty American dollars.” The film cut quickly to reveal the man talking. It was Kevin Brown, the journalist killed in the cemetery just that morning. His face was brown from the African sun. “So where are these guns coming from?” asked Kevin. “Nearly one million AK-47s are made every year in over a dozen countries around the world. They are used by the armies of over eighty countries. Any one of those countries could be selling them illegally to Bonande. And because these guns are unmarked, it has been impossible to discover where they come from . . . until last week, when a mechanic . . .” “Everything OK, sir?” The voice, so close to my shoulder, made me jump. I hurried to stop the film. Standing beside me was the shop assistant. “Yes!” I said, trying to smile. “Yes. Everything’s fine, thank you.” I held up the camera again. “I thought I should try this out with an old tape. I had one in my pocket anyway.” “That’s fine,” nodded the man. “Do you want me to run through the camera’s main functions? It’s an extremely clever piece of equipment. So much of it is automatic. This row of buttons controls the . . .” “I’m fine, thank you,” I interrupted. “Really. I’m happy to explore for myself. I’ll come and find you if I’ve any questions.” The man nodded, but I could see he was disappointed. He wanted to show me everything the camera could do. But at last he turned around and walked back to the counter by the door. When I was sure he wouldn’t hear the tape, I started it again. Kevin had just mentioned something about a mechanic, and now the film showed a huge building full of at least forty lorries. “This is a building near the docks at Umtare, Bonande’s largest international port. Just last week, a mechanic working at Umtare was able to take this film.” As I watched, the picture moved in on the nearest lorry. I could see men working on it. The engine was open; it looked like the lorry had broken down. “These lorries,” continued Kevin’s voice, “were sent to Bonande as aid vehicles. Officially, they are intended to carry drinking water around the country.” The picture moved closer, but it was still from a distance. Obviously the mechanic holding the camera didn’t want to be seen filming. The lorry had been taken apart. The water tank on the back had been completely removed. “But this clearly shows that these lorries are carrying something far more dangerous than water.” As I watched, I could see one man climb onto the lorry. He reached into a hole beneath where the tank had been. Then he passed something down to another man. They were talking happily; they seemed relaxed about their work. And then, as the first man reached down into the hole again, I saw what he had passed to his friend: an AK-47. It looked new. Within minutes, there was a pile of about a dozen new guns on the ground. “These guns are being used to murder the Mapulans. And the Mapulans have no soldiers and no weapons to defend themselves . . .” As the men moved away to work on another lorry, the camera moved quickly closer. The mechanic seemed to be running quickly toward the vehicle. When he arrived at the lorry, the picture turned to the engine. And there, stamped into the metal, was a row of numbers. The picture froze on the numbers as Kevin’s voice continued. “That same manufacturer’s stamp was on more than twenty of those vehicles. They all came to Bonande by ship, directly from the manufacturer. Several people who traveled on the same ship have confirmed that they met no one else on the journey. They also traveled direct, without stopping along the way. That strongly suggests that the manufacturers themselves are responsible. And now we know where the lorries have come from. These numbers reveal that much.” Whatever Kevin had discovered, it had been enough to get him killed. And now I was about to learn the secret. “These guns are being used to murder thousands of innocent people. They’ve been hidden in these lorries to avoid detection by the United Nations inspectors. And the identity stamps make it clear: these lorries were made in Britain.” Calling for help Suddenly, the story had the potential to be enormous. It wasn’t about drugs at all; perhaps the drugs had been hidden in Kevin’s pockets to deceive the police. This story was about international weapons trading. And if the guns were hidden in the lorries by the manufacturers, then that meant that a British company was involved. So someone in Britain was deliberately helping to murder thousands of Mapulans! I had to use the numbers on the lorry’s engine to trace the manufacturers. Perhaps then I could find out exactly who was responsible. I carefully removed the tape from the camera, thinking hard. First, I had to find out which British companies sold aid vehicles abroad. But how? A search on the Internet might have provided answers. I could go to an Internet café. I knew there would be one open somewhere. But then I remembered. I didn’t have any money! And I couldn’t go back to my flat or to the office; the gunman might be waiting for me. I had no choice. I put the tape carefully into my pocket and then approached the shop counter. “Excuse me,” I said. The man turned to me with a smile. “Yes, sir?” “I’m very interested in that camera.” “The Storm C70 is our best model, sir.” “Yes. The problem is, I have to check a few details with my work colleague first. And unfortunately I’ve left my cell phone at home. Do you mind if I borrow your phone? I won’t be long.” “Of course, sir,” replied the man, smiling happily. “It’s through here.” Seconds later, I was alone in a back room, and the phone in Sarah’s flat was ringing. At last, she answered. “Hello?” She sounded sleepy. “Sarah! It’s Pete.” “Pete! Why are . . . ? It’s the middle of the night! Are you OK?” “Listen, Sarah!” I interrupted. “I’ve got a story, and it’s huge. Someone tried to kill me this evening, and I know why. I’ve got a tape. If what’s on the tape is true, it suggests that a British company is breaking the law. They’re selling lorries to the Bonandan Government. And hidden inside each lorry are guns: AK-47s. And those guns are being used to murder the Mapulans.” There was a pause. “So take the tape to the police!” “But the tape only shows what’s happening. It doesn’t say what company’s behind it. I’ve watched it. It shows the engine number of one of the lorries. If we can trace that number to the manufacturers, we’ll know the ‘what’ and the ‘who’! And then we can publish the most important story of the last ten years! The police will take it from there.” Sarah was silent. I could imagine her thoughts. I could go straight to the police, of course. But I only had half the story. And she was a news industry professional; she knew that the full story would be so much better. At last she made up her mind. “What do you want me to do?” “If a country sells aid vehicles to Bonande, they have to report the sale to the United Nations. So there must be an official register somewhere. That’s the first place to look. I need details of any British companies on that register. And then I need to know if any vehicles have this number . . .” I gave her the number of the lorry on the tape. “OK,” she said. “Where are you now?” “I’m in an electrical shop on Tottenham Court Road.” “Are you safe?” “I’m fine. Don’t worry.” “OK. Meet me at Café Bristol in one hour. I’ll see what I can discover.” The story of a lifetime “I’ve found something!” said Sarah. She was sitting opposite me, tired but excited. It was one-thirty in the morning. The café was nearly empty. There was only one old man sitting in the opposite corner, drinking coffee. “What?” I asked. It was good to be talking to her again, without arguing. But even though I had left the gunman far behind, I watched the café door nervously. I was worried that I had put her in danger by involving her. “Just as you told me,” she said, “whenever a country sells any sort of vehicle to Bonande, it must inform the United Nations. All the details of the sale are recorded in an official register. I found that register online. And one of the details recorded is each vehicle’s engine number.” “Go on.” “According to the register, three British companies have sold vehicles to Bonande during the last ten years. I looked through the records of those three companies. And I found it!” “You found the lorry on Kevin Brown’s tape?” “Yes. It was one of forty lorries sold just last month to the Bonandan Government. It was a direct sale by the manufacturers. Like you said, they were listed as aid vehicles for carrying water around the countryside.” “So who built them? What company?” “They’re called FCA Systems.” “I’ve never heard of them.” “They’re a small company, based just outside London, in Surrey. I found out a bit about them. Four years ago, they were a small company making machines for farms. But they had no money and lots of debt. Then suddenly, another company bought FCA Systems. Soon after that, they got their first order for aid vehicles to Bonande. They bought lots of expensive new machines for the factory. And from that moment, they never had any money problems.” Dangerous or not, I was starting to be glad that I’d involved Sarah. I didn’t know anyone else who was so good at research; it often seemed that she could get computers to do or tell her anything she wanted. I knew she would already have an answer to my next question. “So what company bought FCA Systems?” “It was a legal purchase, by Libras International. They’re based in Holland.” “Holland?” “That’s right. But Libras is itself owned by another company called Al Auri. And guess where Al Auri is based.” “Bonande!” “Exactly. The chairman is a man called Damu Jafari.” “Is he connected to the Bonandan Government?” “Not directly.” Sarah smiled. “But he’s a cousin of President Diallo, the President of Bonande.” “So the Bonandans bought a British company to do their work for them! Then they hid the guns in the lorries and sent them home!” “Isn’t there a chance that the guns were hidden in the lorries somewhere along the journey? The records show that the lorries went by ship, directly from Britain to Bonande. But maybe they picked up the guns at sea?” “In the tape, Kevin says he talked to a few people who traveled with the ship. And they were absolutely sure that there was no contanyone else while at sea. Besides, it makes sense to build the lorries in the same place as the guns; that means there’s less risk of discovery.” Sarah nodded. “You think the gunman is working for Bonande?” “He must be. So that’s it! We’ve got the story!” “There’s something else. Kevin Brown always worked with the same cameraman. They shared an office at ADC News. They must have edited the film together.” “The cameraman must know that Kevin’s been killed. He’s probably hiding somewhere. We need to find him. And before the gunman finds him!” “We’re too late, Pete. There was a fire early yesterday morning at the ADC News offices. The cameraman’s body was found later. The official report is that he died in the fire. And all his equipment was destroyed.” “So this tape is the only evidence we’ve got left?” “Exactly. So what are you going to do?” “ContWe need to get the tape to the studio quickly. Once there, we can gather what information we can about FCA Systems and those other companies. And we need to learn as much as we can about the man behind it, this Damu Jafari. And we can copy the tape for broadcast and hand it in to the police. Thanks to you, we’ve already got everything we need to publish the story: we know the companies involved and we know what they’re doing!” I was delighted. I had no doubt that it would be the lead story in The Enquirer the next day. And other newspapers and networks would pick it up from there. Soon, everyone would know my name. And the presenter job would be mine! But Sarah looked worried. “What about the gunman?” “He’s trying to kill me to keep the tape a secret. He thinks that I’m the only person who knows about it. But as soon as the tape’s published, there will be no reason to kill me. And then he’ll stop hunting me. We need to publish the story as soon as possible!” “OK. Let’s go to the office now. But when we get nearer, you should wait a few streets away. The gunman might be waiting there for you.” Sarah and I stepped out into the empty street. We began to walk, looking for a taxi. I was excited and I could tell that Sarah was as well. We had proved once again that we were a good team. “What a way to launch a news channel!” I said. “This is the biggest story of our careers. And it’s going to be great for The Enquirer.” “And good for you, too. Sir James is sure to give you the job now.” “I hope so.” “I just hope we’re not too late to help the situation in Bonande.” “They won’t be able to send any more guns after this.” We walked in silence for a while. “Pete,” said Sarah at last, “whatever I said before, I know that you’re a good man. You’ve proved that in the past. But I can’t help how I feel. I do think you’ve changed. And I can’t help worrying that this job will change you even more.” “How?” “It’s a huge responsibility. Promise me you’ll be careful. Careful of yourself. Careful of getting too comfortable. Careful of being unwilling to criticize the powerful. Because that’s when you’ll stop being a good reporter.” I smiled at that. “You think I’m a good reporter?” Sarah smiled. “Of course.” She stopped and took my hand. “Pete, when you called earlier and told me that a gunman was chasing you, I was terrified. Even if we’re no longer together like we were, I still care for you. You know that, don’t you?” A taxi had appeared. “We should talk about this later,” I said. I put up my hand as it approached. It began to slow down, and I opened the door for her. “Let’s get the tape to David. We’ve got a great story. And we got it together! It’s going to . . .” Suddenly, I stopped, in a panic. Because running down the street toward us was the gunman! Run and hide “Quick!” I shouted. I pushed Sarah inside the taxi. “It’s him! Get in!” The taxi driver heard the panic in my voice. “What’s going . . . ?” “Drive!” I shouted. “That man’s got a gun!” The driver didn’t wait another second. The engine made a loud noise as he hurried to get us away. A quick look out of the back window showed the gunman was still over fifty meters away. But now we were moving down the street and going faster. We were escaping! Then I saw him raise his arm toward us. I pushed Sarah down beneath me onto the floor of the taxi as I heard the shot. Suddenly, the vehicle started to turn sharply. Before I knew what had happened, we had crashed into another car parked along the street. The driver had lost control! And before I could say anything, he had jumped out and was running away. “Quick!” shouted Sarah. “Let’s go!” She had already opened the back door and was climbing out as quickly as possible. “Go that way!” I pointed to the nearest side street as I jumped out beside her. “You’ll be OK; it’s the tape he wants. Find a phone. Call the police.” “Pete!” cried Sarah. Her eyes glanced to the gunman still running down the street toward us. “I’m not leaving you! I can help . . .” “Tell them I’ll try to lead him toward Fulham police station. Now go!” “But Pete . . .” “Now!” Without waiting to argue, I began to run away in the opposite direction. Just before I turned the corner, I looked back. Sarah had disappeared. And the gunman was following me. I couldn’t work out how he had found me. But then I realized. He must have seen me with Sarah in Parliament Square when he stole my briefcase! He knew that I would ask her for help. So when he lost me, he must have followed her. Now she was involved, and it was all my fault. The plan was to lead him toward Fulham police station. But first I had to lead him away from Sarah. Café Bristol was on Fulham Road, near the Royal Brompton Hospital. We’d met there because Sarah’s flat was just a few blocks away. I knew the area well. And as she headed south, I began to run north. The streets were empty. A few cars passed, but it wasn’t safe to stop them. The gunman was too close. If I stopped one, I was worried he would simply kill the driver as well. He had already shown that he was willing to use his gun on innocent people. At the first corner, I turned left. Then I ran to the next corner and waited. If I could get the gunman to follow, I would lead him south again, back toward Fulham Road, and back toward the police station. It was almost three o’clock in the morning, but I knew that the station was open through the night. It was another five minutes away at least, but if Sarah could make that call, they would be ready for the gunman. They would trap him, and Sarah would be safe. Seconds later, the gunman appeared. He saw me and continued chasing, so I hurried round the corner and continued down the street. I was still wearing my work clothes and my feet were beginning to hurt. But I had to get closer to the police station. When I reached the next corner, by Fulham Road, I stopped again, waiting for the gunman. But he didn’t appear. I waited at least ten seconds. I kept my eyes on the last corner, but there was no sign of him. Had I lost him? It didn’t seem possible. And it wasn’t safe to just wait in one place; perhaps he had already come round the corner and I hadn’t seen him. Perhaps he was even now coming closer, hidden behind all the parked cars. Or maybe he’d gone down the next street and was intending to catch me from the other direction. I didn’t have a choice. I had to keep moving. The best plan was to go to the police station anyway, so I continued running. It was still a few minutes away. As I hurried along the pavement, I noticed a figure on the other side of the road, moving in the same direction. It was Sarah! She must have called the police, and was now going to the station to meet me. I didn’t want to cross the street; if the gunman was nearby, I’d be caught in the open. Instead, I hurried closer on the opposite pavement and then quietly called her name. “Sarah!” She turned and saw me. Then she waved for me to cross the street. I shook my head, and pointed forward, toward the station. But she didn’t understand, and began to cross toward me. At that moment, a car appeared up the street. As it came closer, I waved my arms for help. “Hurry!” I called to Sarah. “We can get a lift to the station. Did you speak to the police?” “They’re waiting for us,” she said, as she hurried to my side. “Where is he?” “I don’t know,” I said, still waving at the car. “I think I lost him.” Then I noticed that the car’s side window was broken. In the darkness, I couldn’t see the driver. But as the car slowed, a hand appeared out of the window. And it was holding a gun. I looked around. Behind us was a high brick wall. It was the only escape. “Quick!” I shouted. Within seconds, Sarah was at the top of the wall and I was close behind. Small clouds of dust rose around us as bullets hit the wall, and then we were over. I fell to the ground on the other side and looked around. Without the street lights, it was completely dark, but I knew where I was. I was back in Brompton Cemetery. I could hear the car stopping on the pavement on the other side of the wall. “That way!” I said, pointing deeper into the cemetery. “Hide!” “But the police won’t know we’re here; we have to tell them!” “He’s too close,” I said. I could hear the car door opening on the other side of the wall. “Quick!” In seconds, Sarah had disappeared into the darkness. I began to follow her. Behind us, the gunman was now climbing the wall. We had to just keep moving, to hide among the trees and hope that the police would find us before the gunman did. Surely if we failed to arrive at the station, they would come out and look for us. But would the car lead them to look in the cemetery, even if it was stolen and parked on the pavement with a broken window? As I hurried through the black, I looked behind me. Against the lights of the street, I could see the gunman appearing at the top of the wall. And then he dropped into the darkness. I tried to breathe quietly. And I stepped carefully. I didn’t want to make any noise that would direct him to where I was. But all around me were graves, and I couldn’t avoid them. I was afraid he’d easily hear me bumping into them. At last I stopped. I hid behind a gravestone and listened. But I couldn’t hear anything. I imagined Sarah somewhere up ahead, hiding in the darkness. And then I noticed the sound of a police car. It was far away, but it was slowly coming closer. If they saw the car, they’d be with us in minutes. We just had to stay hidden until they arrived. At that moment, I looked back toward the wall. And against the lights of the street, I noticed another shape appearing on top. Someone else was climbing over! My first thought was that the police were here already and that they were climbing into the cemetery. But then I realized the person on the wall was alone. And she wasn’t climbing in, she was climbing out. It was Sarah! She was trying to let the police know where we were! The gunman would be looking into the cemetery rather than behind him; I could only hope that he wouldn’t see her. But at that moment, the moon appeared from behind a cloud. The whole cemetery was covered in a silver light. And from behind the gravestone where I was hiding, I could clearly see what was happening. Suddenly revealed in the light of the moon, Sarah was easy to see. And the gunman was only meters away. Before I could do anything, he saw her. And then he reached for her. And just before the whole cemetery went dark again, I heard her scream. Time to die “Sarah?” I called. I knew that shouting was dangerous; it would tell the gunman where I was. But I couldn’t stop myself. “Sarah!” At last, out of the darkness, I heard her voice. “Pete?” I tried to see her through the dark, but it was impossible. I started walking in case the gunman was following the sound of my voice. “Are you OK?” I called. “She’s fine—for the moment,” shouted another voice. It was the gunman. “I’ve got her. Now give me the tape, or I’ll kill her.” “If I give you the tape, how do I know you won’t kill her anyway?” “That’s a chance you’ll just have to take.” In the distance, still far beyond the walls of the cemetery, I could hear the police cars coming closer. But even if they saw the stolen car, they were still several minutes away at least. It looked like there was nothing I could do. The man had a gun, and he had Sarah. At that moment, the clouds blew away and the moon reappeared. Everything in the cemetery was clear again. I jumped quickly behind the nearest grave. There, not more than twenty meters away, was the gunman. He had his arm around Sarah’s neck and his gun against her ear. At the sight, I wanted more than anything to give him the tape. I knew that, without it, the people responsible for killing so many innocent Mapulans would escape. But I didn’t care. I loved Sarah, and would have done anything to save her. But I also knew that if I gave him the tape, he would kill us anyway. “I’m over here,” I shouted as I showed my face from behind the grave. At the noise, the gunman turned toward me. “I don’t have the tape on me anymore,” I called. “I’ve put it down on one of these graves.” I pointed at the rows and rows of gravestones. “If you let her go, I’ll tell you which grave it’s on.” In reply, the gunman simply twisted Sarah’s arm behind her back. He waited until she had stopped screaming, and then smiled. “No,” he said. “Bring the tape to me now.” I could see Sarah crying with pain. And behind them both, I could see lights approaching in the sky. It was a helicopter. It was coming closer, and fast. “There’s a helicopter in the sky behind you. It’s the police. They’re coming. You’ve only got a few minutes before they arrive. So this is the situation: if you hurt her, I won’t tell you anything. And if you shoot me, you won’t find the tape. You won’t have time to find it. But later, when it gets light, the police will.” The man said nothing. He looked briefly toward the approaching helicopter, and then, with his arm still around Sarah’s neck, he stared at me in silence. “Let her go,” I continued. “Let her walk away, and I’ll tell you where the tape is.” Finally, the gunman stepped back and pushed Sarah toward me. She ran quickly forward to my side, terrified. Then, with his gun still pointing at us both, the man pulled out a cell phone. Seconds later, he was speaking quickly into the phone. But he was talking quietly; I couldn’t hear what he was saying. He seemed to be explaining the situation. It looked as if he was receiving orders. At last, he nodded, and hung up. “Have you made any copies?” he asked. “None,” I answered. “We haven’t even watched it yet. We haven’t had time. So we don’t know anything; I don’t even know who you are. There’s only one tape, and you can have it. And that will be the end of this. Just let her go.” But the gunman simply looked once more toward the helicopter and smiled. Whatever he was planning, he obviously thought he had plenty of time. “Either you have the tape or you don’t,” he said, calmly. “And unless you give it to me now, I have no use for either of you. Give me the tape or I’ll kill you both.” “If you shoot me,” I shouted, “you’ll never find the tape before the police get here!” I was desperate. Behind the gunman’s head, I could see the helicopter coming close. “I’ll take that chance,” he said, and I knew at that moment that he was planning to kill us both. There was nothing I could do. There was nowhere to hide. As the man pointed his gun at us, I stepped in front of Sarah and tried to protect her body with mine. But I knew that this man would kill us and never think about us again. I held Sarah tight behind me. “I’m so sorry,” I said. “This is all my fault.” As I waited for the bullet that would kill me, I closed my eyes. All I could think of was Sarah. “I love you,” I told her. I wanted to hear Sarah tell me that she loved me, too. I wanted the last words I ever heard to be hers. But there was no time; the shot came first. Rescued? The few seconds after that gun shot seemed to last so much longer. I couldn’t feel the bullet. I couldn’t even feel any pain. I realized I must be in shock. Unless I died first, I knew that the pain would come later. I opened my eyes. The world was no longer dark, but bright. It was brighter than a summer’s day. It was as if I was staring into the sun, and my body was shaking like I was caught in a wild wind. The noise of it rushed all around me. And still I could feel no pain. I thought perhaps I was already dead. I looked down at my body. I felt my chest and my stomach. Only then did I realize that I’d not been hit. And then I felt a panic like I’ve never felt before. I thought he’d shot Sarah. I turned around quickly. Sarah was still standing beside me. Her face was pale in the bright light and her eyes were wide with shock, but she was OK. “Peter Booker?” Somewhere, a voice was shouting my name. I turned toward the light. It was softer now, and I could see that it came from a huge lamp. The lamp was attached to the helicopter that had landed beside us in the cemetery. The engine was still running noisily. On the ground beside the helicopter was the gunman. He was kneeling on the grass, unhurt. Two men stood above him with guns in their hands. “Mr. Booker?” shouted the voice again. A woman was standing beside me. I held Sarah close and nodded. “Mr. Booker, my name is Paula Jansen. Are you OK?” I looked at the woman. She was in her fifties and dressed in a smart suit. At last I answered her with a nod. “I’m sorry about the gun shot. We had to warn him.” She pointed at the gunman. “We saw him preparing to shoot you, and had no choice.” “Who are you?” I asked. “I work for MI6—national security.” She pulled out an identity card from her pocket. “The tape,” I said. “He’s after a tape.” “I know,” nodded Jansen. “Is the tape safe?” I nodded. “Where is it?” “Here.” I reached into my pocket. “Have you watched it? You know what it contains?” “Yes. British lorries are being used to illegally transport guns to Bonande. And the guns are being used to murder thousands of Mapulans.” “But does the tape make it clear where the guns and lorries are coming from? Can it tell us who’s involved?” I nodded. “It clearly shows an identity stamp on the lorries. We traced the numbers to FCA Systems. They’re a company based in Surrey, with strong connections to Bonande.” “That’s all?” I nodded. The woman looked disappointed. “We already know about FCA Systems,” she said. “We’ve been watching them for weeks. Are you absolutely sure this tape can’t give us any more information?” “There’s nothing else on it. Just that lorry’s number.” Jansen took the tape from me. “You were lucky, Mr. Booker,” she said, pointing to the gunman. “This man is very dangerous. He’s a professional killer. We’ve been after him for months. I’m glad we found you in time.” “Thank you. I’m grateful.” I turned and put my arm around Sarah with a smile. “It’s over—we can publish our story! We can still make today’s front page.” But Paula Jansen heard me and shook her head. “I’m afraid not. You can’t publish this story today.” “What do you mean? Why not?” “Because we haven’t yet arrested the people at FCA Systems. We need to be sure we get everyone involved. If you publish your story today, you’ll ruin our operation.” “But this story is important!” I said. “How long do we have to wait?” “Twenty-four hours at the most. I’ll contas soon as we’ve arrested everyone. And then you can have your story, I promise.” She held up the tape. “Is this the only copy?” “Yes. I was going to . . .” “Good,” interrupted Jansen. “Leave it all to us. I’ll be in touch.” Above the sound of the helicopter, I could hear police cars arriving on the other side of the wall. “The police will take care of you from here,” shouted Jansen, as the helicopter prepared to take off. She nodded at the two men and they pushed the gunman aboard. “I’ll be in touch soon,” she shouted, as she climbed in after them. “How?” I shouted back. “You don’t have my telephone number.” Jansen smiled. “We’re MI6, Mr. Booker,” she called back. “We know everything about you.” As the helicopter slowly rose off the ground, Sarah and I stepped back. Jansen waved, and then her face disappeared. The helicopter began to climb into the night. At that moment, half a dozen policemen with guns ran out of the darkness. “Get on the ground!” they shouted. They were taking no chances. Sarah and I put our hands up and dropped to our knees. Immediately, rough hands were running over our bodies. They were checking to see if we had any weapons. “They’re clear!” shouted a man beside me. “Identify yourselves!” shouted another. “I’m Peter Booker,” I said. “And I’m Sarah Fulton. I made the phone call asking for help.” “We’re journalists with The Enquirer,” I added. The policeman in charge stepped forward. “Any identification?” I shook my head. My wallet was still sitting on my coffee table in my flat. “Here,” said Sarah. She gave a small purse to the policeman. He opened it and began to inspect the name on her bank cards. At last he was satisfied. “So where’s the man you mentioned to the emergency services, Miss Fulton?” he asked, as he gave back her purse. “Where’s this gunman?” “It’s OK,” I answered. “He’s already been caught.” I pointed up toward the helicopter. It was now moving away across the city. “That’s an MI6 helicopter. Paula Jansen’s in charge. And she’s got the gunman under arrest.” The policeman turned to speak to one of his men. “Radio the station,” he said. “Tell them to check that helicopter, registration G3496.” “Yes, Sergeant.” The policeman then turned back to us. “So why was this man after you?” “It’s just as I said on the phone,” answered Sarah. “Kevin Brown—the journalist who was killed here in the cemetery yesterday morning—was killed because of a tape. And when Pete found that tape, he was almost killed as well.” “The gunman wanted to destroy it,” I added. “And he’s the same person who shot that journalist yesterday morning?” asked the sergeant. “Yes,” I nodded. “You’re sure about that?” “Absolutely sure. He also broke into my flat. He was looking for the tape.” “And what’s so special about the tape?” “It’s evidence, of an international crime . . .” Just then, one of the other policemen came running forward. “Are you sure you got that helicopter’s registration number right, Sergeant?” “Yes. I saw it clearly as it was taking off. Why?” “Because I spoke to the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department of Defense.” “Well?” “There is no helicopter with the registration G3496. It must have been a false number. And the station spoke to MI6. They know Paula Jansen. But she retired three years ago, aged sixty-eight. And she died six months later.” Hunting for evidence I couldn’t speak. As Sarah turned to me in surprise, I just stood in silence. I was too angry to say anything. “Oh my God!” she said. “They were all working together! The helicopter must have been helping to follow us.” I shook my head. I was angry with myself for being so foolish. Without asking any questions, I had just given away the only piece of evidence we had—to a stranger! I had thrown away my story, and with it I had lost any chance of helping thousands of Mapulans. “You didn’t ask this woman for any identification?” asked the sergeant. “She showed me a card,” I managed to answer. I was so angry I was finding it difficult to speak. “We were just going to be shot. But Jansen, or whatever her name is, she saved us. After that, I never thought to question her.” The policeman looked puzzled. “So why did she leave you alive? If she was working with the gunman, why did she save you?” I was wondering that myself. But then the answer was obvious. “Because without the tape, we’ve got nothing against her. And three dead journalists in the same place within twenty-four hours would only cause more questions!” I said. “She’s cleverer than that. She told me exactly what I wanted to hear to allow her to take what she wanted. She promised me a big story, anything that would allow her to escape with the tape!” “So now we’ve got nothing!” said Sarah. “Without that tape, we don’t have any evidence.” “I’ll get a team to look around here when it gets light,” said the sergeant. “They may have left something behind that will help us identify them. But right now you’ll have to come to the police station. We’ll have to file a report. You’ll have to give us statements.” Twenty minutes later, Sarah and I walked into Fulham police station. There, the sergeant handed us over to the police officer on duty. We were led into a room and we sat around a table. “Please,” I said to the police officer. “You have to send some men round to a company in Surrey immediately. The company’s called FCA Systems.” “Why?” “Because you might find the person who tried to kill me— the same person who broke into my flat. And the same person who murdered Kevin Brown in Brompton Cemetery yesterday morning.” “And,” added Sarah, “the same person who probably killed Kevin’s cameraman and then set fire to the offices of ADC News.” “How do you know all of this?” I had no choice. I had to reveal at least a little more. “Kevin Brown was killed because he had a tape. That tape showed that FCA Systems is breaking international law.” The police officer scratched his chin. “And where’s that tape now?” “It was taken from me just now in Brompton Cemetery. It was taken by a woman who called herself Paula Jansen. She escaped with Kevin Brown’s murderer just before the police arrived. That’s why you have to send some men to Surrey now. Jansen knows that FCA Systems is the only link we have. You have to search the company’s offices immediately!” The police officer shook his head. “I can’t send my men out there in the middle of the night without any evidence.” “But you can if you suspect that a crime has been committed! If a delay risks the destruction of evidence, you have the power to break into the building.” “Perhaps—if I believe that a crime has been committed. But in this case I have no proof that that office is connected to any illegal activity. I have only your word for it.” “What about Kevin Brown?” I asked. “You know that he was murdered. And now I’m telling you I know where the murderer is!” “No,” replied the police officer. “You’re telling me you think you know where the murderer might be!” “And what if I’m right?” The police officer was silent for a moment. “OK,” he said at last. “I’ll call the local police station in Surrey. If they’ve got a free car, they can send someone round to have a look at the office. But that’s all I can do for the moment.” “Thank you,” I said. “Wait here,” said the police officer as he walked to the door. “I’ll be back in a minute.” In fact, he was gone almost an hour. During that time, Sarah and I just waited at the table. We grew more and more impatient. At one point, another policeman arrived with cups of coffee and some sandwiches. We were hungry and tired, but my anger kept me wide awake. I was still feeling stupid. And Sarah could see it. “Don’t worry, Pete,” she said. “I would have done the same. And we’re both still alive. That’s the main thing.” At last the police officer reappeared. “Did you contSurrey police?” I asked. “Yes, I did.” “What did they find?” “They drove out to look at the offices of FCA Systems, just like you asked. And they found nothing. The lights are off. No one is there. If they have time, they’ll go back in the morning. But for now, that’s all we can do.” I was very disappointed. But there was nothing more I could say to convince him. “Can we go home now?” I asked. “So you’re not worried about the gunman?” he asked. “He didn’t want us; he just wanted that tape. And now he has it.” “If that’s what you want,” said the police officer. “I’ll have someone drive you home. Then we can check your flat. Perhaps the gunman left some form of identification by mistake.” “Would you mind sending someone over in the morning instead?” I asked. “I think I’d just like to get some sleep now. And we’ll be fine with a taxi.” “Fine,” he answered. “Then you’re free to go.” A few minutes later, Sarah and I were sitting in the back of a taxi. Neither of us said anything. Although we had both escaped alive, it felt like we had lost. Inside, I was screaming with anger. “It’s over then,” sighed Sarah, at last. “If Jansen and the gunman aren’t at FCA Systems, there’s no way of knowing where they are. Or who they are.” “The police can’t help us find any evidence. They have to follow their procedures. But there’s something that we can do that the police can’t.” “What?” I looked at my watch. “It’s almost four o’clock. Let’s collect your car. We could be in Surrey by five.” “Why? What are you going to do?” “They broke into my flat. Now I’m going to break into their office.” Walking into danger In the light of the moon, it was clear that the building was more like a factory than an office. We had parked Sarah’s car further up the road and walked quietly through the night toward the front gate. We stopped about forty meters away in case there were security cameras. Even from there, we could see that the gate was heavily locked. And the office beyond was in darkness. “I can understand why the police think no one’s in there,” said Sarah. “That’s because they didn’t go any closer. But either Jansen has already left, or she’s in there now. Because she knows that we know about this place.” “So how are we going to get inside?” I looked around. A high fence ran all around the grounds. It seemed to be at least fifty meters from the building in every direction. “Let’s follow the fence. Perhaps there’s another way in.” Ten minutes later, we were on the other side of the building. But there was still no sign of any entrance. Nor did we notice any activity inside. “Look!” Sarah whispered. At the back of the building, a door had opened. Someone was stepping out. “It’s the gunman!” I said. Against the light from behind him, I could see his long hair. “That proves it! Jansen must have come straight here!” “Let’s call the police, then,” answered Sarah. “We can tell them to come back.” “We can’t wait that long! If there’s any proof, it’s inside those offices. Jansen knows that—she’s probably destroying the evidence right now!” “So what can we do?” I looked up at the fence. It was about ten feet high and made of wire. “Help me up,” I said. “I should be able to climb over.” “No! Even if you can climb over, I won’t be able to follow you. And you won’t be able to get back by yourself.” “I don’t need to get back,” I answered. “I just need to find some evidence before it’s destroyed. Help me over, and then call the police. Tell them to hurry. They can let me out.” “But what if Jansen’s men catch you and the police don’t get here in time? Do you think they’ll just let you walk away?! I’m not going to help you run to your death.” “They won’t do anything to me if they know the police are on their way. Look, Sarah, we don’t have any choice! If we don’t find some evidence of what Jansen’s been doing, she’ll win this. And then no one will pay for all those Mapulan deaths. We have to try!” I could see that she knew it made sense. But she wasn’t happy. “Don’t worry,” I smiled, trying to reassure her. “I’ll be fine. Once I’m over the fence, get back to the car and call the police. Wait for them there. Jansen’s not going to escape this time.” With only a slight hesitation, I stepped closer and took her hand. Then I bent to kiss her cheek. At the last moment, she turned her head, and kissed my lips. “Be careful,” she said. “I’ll see you in a few minutes,” I said, and turned back to the fence. I pulled myself up until I was standing on Sarah’s shoulders. I could feel her struggling to support my weight. But it gave me the height I needed, and, a few seconds later, I dropped down onto the other side. “Be careful!” she whispered again, through the wire. “I’ll be fine. Go and call the police.” As Sarah disappeared in the direction of the car, I turned and moved slowly toward the building. I was looking for places to hide as I approached. I couldn’t see any security cameras around the building. And although there were security lights, they were turned off. I wondered if there would be anyone left to watch the cameras anyway. But I knew that the gunman was somewhere nearby. Suddenly, I heard footsteps. The moon was still out, and there was nowhere to hide. Trusting that no one was looking for me, I could only drop to the ground. The gunman reappeared from around the corner of the building. Without even a look in my direction, he walked back to the door. As it opened, I could see more of what was happening inside. The office was a large industrial building with a concrete floor. I couldn’t see a lock or security system on the door. But, just in case, I rushed up to follow the gunman. As he stepped inside, I held the closing door slightly open. Then I waited and listened to the sound of the gunman walking away. A few seconds later, I heard another door opening. Someone was talking up ahead, but I couldn’t hear what was being said. Slowly, I opened the door wider and looked inside properly. It was a large space. The area was full of complicated machines. They were all organized in a long line around the building. All around were signs of industrial work: engine parts, supplies of oil, tires, and lots of tools. And there, at the end of the line, near to where I was standing, were three lorries. They were exactly the same as the ones on the tape. So this was obviously where they were built. It looked like they had suddenly stopped production. But to prove that the company was doing something illegal, I had to find proof that they had been making guns as well. I needed to find technical drawings, or a store of guns, or at least records of their sale to Bonande. That was the only way to prove that the company was doing something illegal. About twenty meters ahead, I could see another door. And in the wall beyond there was a glass window. It looked as if there was an office behind the window; the window would have allowed the bosses to sit in comfort but still watch their workers. And from the sound of his voice, I knew the gunman was just inside. If there was still any evidence, that was where it would be. I needed to see what he was doing in there. Then I could tell the police where to look when they arrived. Slowly, I stepped inside the building. As quietly as possible, I hurried over to hide behind the nearest lorry. Stepping quickly up, I looked inside the cabin. The vehicle looked completely finished and ready for sale; the key was in place and the leather seats were shining. I went back down on my knees and listened. Still, the gunman was talking on the other side of the door. But now that I was a little closer, I thought I could recognize the other voice. It was Jansen. Holding my breath, I crossed over quickly until I could kneel just below the window. From there, by slowly raising my head above the bottom of the window, I could see them. But the window glass was too thick to hear them properly. I could only understand a few words. Jansen was talking. I heard only a name: “Jafari.” Jansen was sitting at a desk less than five meters away, and looking toward the gunman. She was asking something about the Bonandan behind FCA Systems. In reply the gunman shook his head and mentioned Bonande. Whatever he said, it made Jansen’s face twist into an angry smile, and she nodded. I guessed that Jafari had already hurried back to Bonande. And, judging by Jansen’s reaction, he’d left her to clear up the evidence. Then Jansen asked another question. The gunman nodded and said something about software on computers. “You’re sure?” asked Jansen. Again, the gunman nodded, and now I understood: the gunman had been destroying any evidence left on the office computers. Jansen smiled, pleased. And then, still talking, she held up her hand. And in it was Kevin Brown’s tape. So there was still a chance! If I could somehow get that tape, I’d have the evidence we needed. Perhaps it was the only bit of evidence that hadn’t yet been destroyed. But then, before I could do anything, Jansen dropped the tape onto the hard floor. And then she stamped on it again and again. Soon, it was just a small pile of broken plastic. Jansen said something about a fire, and the gunman bent down and began to pick up the remains of the tape. Jansen looked at her watch. “Right,” I heard her say, and then she said something else. Her voice wasn’t clear, but it sounded like, “I’ve got to go back to the village.” Before I could work out what she meant, she was moving toward the door. As quietly as possible, I ran back the way I had come. But just as I was approaching the outside door, it opened. “Sarah!” She was standing in the light. “Quick,” I whispered, “let’s go! Jansen’s . . .” I froze. Standing behind Sarah was one of the men we had seen earlier in the helicopter. And now he was pointing his gun at me. There was nothing I could do. Slowly, I raised my hands. Out of the darkness “Step back,” ordered the man. He pushed Sarah inside to follow me. “I’m sorry, Pete,” she said. “He just came out of the darkness. I didn’t have . . .” “Quiet!” said the man. At that moment, Jansen and the gunman appeared behind me. “The police know we’re here,” I said loudly. “They’re on their way. They know all about FCA Systems.” Jansen said nothing. Her face showed no emotion at all. She simply turned and walked back inside the office. Seconds later, the gunman reappeared. “Empty your pockets,” he said. The other man stepped forward. “She was about to use this,” he said. He gave the gunman Sarah’s cell phone. “Anything else?” Slowly, unsure, Sarah emptied her pockets. She took out her car keys, her purse, and a small notepad. The gunman held out his hand, but she didn’t give them to him. She just dropped them on the floor instead. The gunman just smiled. Then he stepped forward and ran his hands down her body to see if she had anything else. He was smiling as he did it. At last, he turned to me. “Anything on you?” I shook my head, but he checked me briefly anyway. All the usual contents of my pockets were still in my flat. Then the gunman picked up the car keys. “They must have parked near the gate. I’ll bring the car inside. Take them to the southeast corner, where the ground’s rough. You know what to do.” The man nodded. “But keep it quiet,” added the gunman, as he stepped out the door. “I’ll be over in five minutes.” Had I understood properly? It seemed that the gunman had just ordered our deaths! And from the look on Sarah’s face, she thought the same. But there was nothing we could do. With a gun pointing at us, we had no choice. The man pushed us in silence back outside. It was still night, but now the moon was hidden behind thick cloud; the whole area was dark. He directed us along a path beside the factory. “Wait!” he said, as we approached the corner of the building. There was a switch on the nearest wall, and he pressed it. A security light came on just behind us. It was attached to the wall, and pointing out toward the fence surrounding the factory. In the weak light, I couldn’t see much—just rough ground covered in grass and a few bushes, and the thick woods beyond the fence. And I knew then exactly what was planned. If the man was right and he’d caught Sarah before she’d called the police, they wouldn’t be coming to help. And even if she had managed to use her phone, they would arrive too late. We would be dead within minutes. I wondered if I could stop the man, even just for a second, to let Sarah escape. It seemed unlikely. He carried his gun like a professional soldier, and he was obviously ready to shoot me without thinking. We didn’t have a chance. But I had to do something. Even if I couldn’t get away myself, I had to try to help Sarah. And I had to do it quickly, before the gunman came back. We were now near the fence. It was a quiet corner, and on the far side of the factory from the main gate. There was no reason for anyone to walk this way; it was the perfect place to bury two dead bodies. If they killed us here, no one would ever know. And without any possessions, it might be a long time before we were even identified. “Stop here!” ordered the man. We stopped. I turned to face Sarah. “I’m so sorry,” I said. “This isn’t your fault, Pete,” she whispered. Her voice was shaking but, despite her fear, her eyes shone with a calm, inner strength. In that moment, I found her more beautiful than ever. But that only made me feel worse. I felt sick, not because I was about to die, but because I was responsible for her death. I had gotten her involved in this. “Kneel down,” the man shouted. “Put your hands on your head.” I had to act. I knew that I wouldn’t survive, whatever happened. But I had to do something. As Sarah began to kneel, I moved slightly forward as though I was helping her. I put out my arms like I was lowering her to the ground. But, at the last second, I pushed her aside and jumped at the man with the gun. “Run!” I shouted. I knew that I didn’t really have a chance. After all, he was a soldier. I was just a journalist. I spent my days sitting at a desk or talking to people over lunch. He probably spent his days running up and down mountains, and learning how to kill people quietly and painfully. But perhaps he knew that. Perhaps he knew the difference between us. And perhaps that made him more relaxed than he should have been. As I jumped toward him, he stepped back in surprise. But instinct made him also raise the gun. I put out my hands to push the gun away. I was desperate to stop it pointing toward Sarah, who was already on her feet and running. But I missed the gun. And as the man swung his arm in defense, the gun hit me on the head. It wasn’t a hard knock, but I felt dizzy. Still, I managed to grab at the man, to stop him from chasing Sarah. “Go!” I shouted to her, throwing myself onto him. “Get out of here!” From the corner of my eye, I could see her running. She was heading back toward the building, away from where we had come. And then, just as she disappeared behind the corner, the man hit me hard in the stomach. I couldn’t do anything; instantly weak, I fell to my knees. I tried to pull myself along the wet ground, into the darkness, away from the gunman, but I was coughing and coughing. The man stepped toward me. As he raised his gun to my head, I thought only of Sarah. At least I had given her a chance. “What’s going on?” I looked up. The gunman was walking across the grass toward us. “What the hell’s happened?” he asked. “He jumped me,” said the man, still pointing his gun at my head. “The woman ran round there.” “Finish him,” answered the gunman. “Then follow me. She won’t have gone far . . .” That second, there was a loud crash. And in that instant, the world turned black. Running from bullets It was Sarah. She had broken the security light. “Run, Pete!” I heard her voice through the dark. And as I threw myself to the side, I heard a sound like a cough. The man had fired his gun. But although my legs were shaking and I still felt dizzy, I had rolled far enough. He had missed me. And seconds later I managed to get to my feet. Then, before they could catch me, I was running into the darkness. I didn’t go straight toward the building, where Sarah had been. And I didn’t go straight toward the fence. I hurried as quietly as I could toward the more open ground, away from anyone. I knew it wouldn’t be long until they turned on more lights, so I hurried to get as far away as possible. Even if Sarah’s car was now inside the fence, the gunman had her keys. And we all knew there was only one gate in the fence, and that was locked. But they would also know that we couldn’t climb over the fence alone. I had to find Sarah. Even if I was left behind, there was still a chance that I could help her get away. I was just wondering how I could find her when I tripped over a bush and fell. I was lucky, because at that moment the moon briefly reappeared. If I hadn’t been flat on the ground, the men would have seen me. In the light of the moon, I saw them moving in my direction. They had spread out, and were walking slowly forward, guns ready. And in that second before the moon disappeared and everything went dark again, I saw Sarah. She had run even further around the building and was now pushing herself against the wall, trying to hide. As the men moved slowly closer to her, I saw her looking anxiously around for an escape. It wouldn’t be long before they found her. So, at the risk of making a noise, I ran directly toward where I had last seen her. Soon, I was beside the building. With one hand out to guide me along the wall, I kept moving. A few steps later, I felt her, and quickly gave her arm a squeeze to let her know it was me. I was just going to pull her across the grass toward the fence when I had an idea. Changing my mind, I pulled her forward, further along the wall. Together, we silently ran on around the building, back toward the door. The men were somewhere behind us, not far away. But I was hoping that they would never imagine we would run straight back toward Jansen. Soon, we were back at the main door. Sarah looked puzzled, but I nodded to calm her and then carefully looked inside the building. It was empty. Either Jansen had already left, or she was inside the office. I pointed toward the nearest lorry, and waved at Sarah to follow me. Seconds later, I was helping her up into the lorry’s cabin. Soon she was sitting in the driver’s seat. There were the keys there, just as I had seen them earlier. “Wait until I’ve got the door open, then start the engine,” I told her. “And then just drive. This lorry should be able to break through the gate. It’s heavy enough. I’ll jump on as you pass. Whatever you do, don’t stop.” At Sarah’s nod, I ran back toward where we’d come in. The door itself was a small part of a larger gate for vehicles. Only the door locked; the gate was just shut from the inside with a metal bar. As quietly as possible, I moved the bar away. And then I began to swing the gate open. Behind me, the building filled with noise as Sarah started the lorry’s engine. There was a moment’s pause as she tried to get the lorry moving, and then it began to roll toward me. It was getting faster with every second. “Jump in!” shouted Sarah, as the lorry rushed past and through the gate. I had just pulled myself up and opened the side door when the gunman ran round the corner. If he hadn’t reacted so quickly, we would have run him over. He threw himself backwards just in time, and then we were past him. As I climbed inside, we went quickly down the drive toward the front gate. As Sarah concentrated on driving, I watched in the side mirror. In the light from the factory, I could see that the other man had appeared. He was firing his gun at us. I don’t know if he hit the lorry or not. It made no difference; we were protected by the large water tank on the back. The man began to run after us, but we were pulling quickly away. “Hold on!” shouted Sarah. The engine made a loud noise as we got closer to the gate, still going faster and faster. And then, seconds later, we hit the gate. The lorry shook and there was a sound like tearing metal, but we hardly slowed. Our large wheels ran easily over bits of broken gate, and then we were out on the road. “We did it!” I shouted. I couldn’t believe we had escaped. “Well done!” Then I noticed that we were slowing down. “What are you doing?” I cried. “Keep going! We’ve got to keep moving!” “We can’t,” answered Sarah. “We’ve run out of petrol!” An empty victory I looked at the petrol register. Sarah was right; the lorry was totally empty. “I guess they only put enough in these vehicles to move them around the factory line,” she said. I looked again in the mirror, but it was too dark to see the gunmen. “OK,” I said. “We’ve got to run. Let’s go!” Rather than run down the road, we rushed into the woods. It was the only place we couldn’t easily be followed. We walked carefully through the trees, always in sight of the road. “Did you manage to call the police?” I asked quietly. “I didn’t have time. I’m sorry. He caught me only minutes after I left you at the fence.” “It doesn’t matter. Even if we tell the police everything we know, there’s still no evidence.” “You didn’t find anything?” “Jansen and the gunman were in the office. I tried to hear what they were saying. They’ve already taken any evidence off the computers. And I saw Jansen break the tape into little pieces. So that’s it. There’s no evidence left.” “Only us.” “But we haven’t any proof! There’s nothing we can do. We’ve no evidence of what FCA Systems has been doing. And we’ve nothing to show that Jansen’s connected to the company. We don’t even know who she is!” “At least we’re alive.” “For the moment, maybe. But she knows exactly who we are. She knows where to find us. We might have escaped for the moment, but Jansen can send her gunmen after us at any time. We can’t get her, but she can get us whenever she wants.” It was a frightening thought. Would we have to live with that threat forever? “Do you think they’re still following us?” asked Sarah. “I’m not sure. It would be easier for them to simply wait for us at our flats. Or at The Enquirer.” “So what are we going to do? Is there nothing more we can tell the police? Or are we just going to wait for Jansen to try to kill us again?!” I didn’t answer. We continued to walk in silence. Above the road, not far away, the sky was full of stars. It was really a beautiful night. “Pete?” said Sarah at last. “I’ve been thinking. You’ve done the right thing with this story, and I’m proud of you. But the deal is done. The Bonandans already have their guns.” “What are you saying?” “We’ve lost. Jansen has won. I think that we should forget this story, not tell anyone. If Jansen sees that we’ve not published the story after a week or two, she’ll know that we’re not going to. We have to convince her that we’re going to keep quiet. That’s the only way to stop her coming after us. We need to persuade her that we’re not a threat.” “Do you really think she’ll take that risk? She could arrange for us to be killed at any time, in any place. Why should she let us live? And anyway,” I was angry now, not at Sarah, but at the idea of defeat, “if we give up now, that’s not going to help all those Mapulans who are being killed!” “Maybe it’s too late for them. But there will be others who need help. And we’ll be in a position to help even more; with the TV news channel, we’ll be able to make even more of a difference. Sir James has invested a lot of money in that studio to make sure we can do the best job possible. Those computers are the best you can buy. And the cameras alone must have cost a fortune—Storm C70s are thousands of pounds each!” “What did you say?” “Those cameras in the studio—they’re so expensive.” “Storm C70s! The studio cameras are Storm C70s?” “Yes.” “When I watched the tape in that electrical shop, I used a Storm C70.” “So?” “When David showed us around the studio, he said that Storm C70s record everything automatically onto the hard drive!” “That’s true. Whatever’s on the screen . . .” Sarah stopped, realizing. “You mean we’ve got a copy of that tape after all?” “Maybe.” Up ahead, I could see a small parking area by the road. And in the parking area was a public phone box. We started walking toward it. “But Pete,” said Sarah, “it makes no difference! You said it yourself: we don’t even know who Jansen is. If you make that tape public, it won’t change anything. Apart from one man in Bonande, we still won’t know who’s to blame here in Britain. And Jansen could still come after us.” She paused. “Let’s just forget about it. We’ll pretend this never happened.” The idea was appealing. But I couldn’t just forget everything I knew. I couldn’t accept defeat. After all, I had seen the pictures on that tape. I had seen the bodies of all those dead Mapulans. And I just didn’t believe that Jansen would let us live. “Sarah, we have to try to tell this story. That’s the only chance we have. If we broadcast Kevin’s tape, the police will have to look into it. Perhaps they’ll find out who Jansen is.” “And if Jansen kills us because of it?” “She’s already trying to kill us! But at least we’ll have told the story first,” I replied. I picked up the phone and ordered a taxi. And then I began to dial David’s number. Beside me, Sarah was looking anxiously back up the road. Seconds later, I was speaking to our boss. “David?” I said. “It’s Pete.” “Pete! Where the hell are you? This is our big day! The big launch. And I’ve been trying to contsince last night. Sir James called. He liked your report with his cousin in Parliament Square. And at last he’s confirmed it: he wants you to be the presenter of the channel. Congratulations!” I didn’t say anything. “Pete? Did you hear me? The job’s yours.” Suddenly, I felt more tired than ever before—not just physically, but mentally as well. I had just been offered one of the most powerful roles in the British media. But for all that power, I still couldn’t catch Jansen, or the other people responsible for so many deaths in Mapula. For all my new power, I felt useless. “Pete?” repeated David. “What do you think? That’s great news, isn’t it?” “Great,” I answered, without real enthusiasm. “I’ll see you in the office.” Then I just hung up the phone. Ten minutes later, our taxi arrived. As Sarah and I sped back into London, I stared unhappily out the window. The presenter job was mine. And Sarah’s behavior over the previous hours had convinced me that our relationship wasn’t dead at all. I should have been delighted. But still I felt like I had lost. Forced to give up “This is proof, David,” I said as he watched the tape. “It’s proof that FCA Systems is breaking international law.” Sarah and I had arrived at the studio only minutes before. I had insisted on going first to the electrical shop, and now we had a copy of the tape that Jansen had been determined to destroy! Sarah wasn’t happy. She still thought that Jansen would let us live if we just kept quiet. But I disagreed; I thought we should broadcast the tape on the TV news show. It was our only chance to catch Jansen before she caught us. “So who’s behind FCA Systems?” David asked. “And who is Jansen?” “The company is registered to one man,” I answered. “A Bonandan called Damu Jafari. We don’t know who Jansen is.” David was silent as he thought. And then, at last, he shook his head. “No,” he said. “You can’t broadcast this. Maybe there’s a story here. But without any idea of Jansen’s identity, it’s not enough.” “But broadcasting the story now is our only chance of finding out who she is!” I argued. “If we go public with this, the police will be forced to investigate further. And the longer we leave it, the more time Jansen will have to cover her tracks. The more time she’ll have to silence us forever!” “Pete, I’m sorry. If you’re in danger, you should go to the police. But we’re not going to run this story; we’ve got other things to worry about. Now go and get ready. We’re opening with a report from the village.” “From where?” “The village. Westminster! Our first report is a live link with our reporter in Parliament Square about the oil crisis.” “Of course! The village! Westminster is sometimes known as ‘the village,’ isn’t it?” David looked at me like I was mad. “You know it is.” “The village and the oil crisis,” I said. “That’s it!” “What?” asked Sarah. “I heard Jansen say that she had to get back to the village— I’m sure she meant Westminster!” “Honestly, Pete!” said David. “It could have been any village.” “But think about it; it makes sense! Bonande is rich in oil. I bet Jansen works for the Government, probably the Department of Energy or the Department of Trade. Britain needs oil, and Bonande needs guns. I think Jansen has arranged an oil deal with the Bonandans; she’s giving them cheap AK-47s, and they’re giving us cheap oil. That must be it!” “That’s a guess!” said David. “And even if you’re right, even if Jansen does work for the Government, you still need proof! How can you prove that Jansen—or whatever she’s really called—is mixed up in this?” “Sarah and I would swear to it. Jansen’s men tried to kill us! And the police already know about the gunman in the cemetery. The rest would just confirm our story. Then there’s Kevin Brown’s murder.” “And the death of his cameraman in the ADC News fire,” added Sarah. “But none of that is related directly to Jansen!” answered David. “If she takes you to court, it will be your word against the word of a senior Government official—if that’s what she is. And without proof, you will lose. No, my decision stands. You’ve not got enough evidence to run this story yet. You need to confirm that Jansen does work for the Government, and then use that information to keep trying to find a clear connection.” “But David . . .” “Pete, listen! Sir James’s cousin works at the Department of Trade! If you start accusing Dr. Mawle’s department without any proof, we’ll all be out of a job. So until you have solid proof that connects Jansen to FCA Systems, I don’t want to hear anything more about this.” As David disappeared into the control room at the back of the studio, I turned to Sarah. “We’ve still got half an hour until the launch. Will you do me a favor? Help me to confirm Jansen’s identity. Please? If Jansen does work for the Government, that information will be accessible to everyone. We should start with the Department of Energy, then the Department of Trade. They’re the two departments involved in the sale of oil and weapons.” “Why? That still won’t give us the proof we need.” “Please, Sarah! I have to know who Jansen really is.” Sarah turned to the studio computer screen. “Here you are,” she said, only seconds later. “This is the official website for the Department of Energy.” “Is there any information about the people working there?” “There’s a long list of the senior employees,” she nodded. “With photos.” Thirty seconds later, we had checked through them all. None of them looked like Jansen. “Try the Department of Trade,” I said. “Pete,” she said, typing quickly. “We’re wasting our time. You should get ready.” But she was already loading up the website for the Department of Trade. And with a click of a button, we were looking at the people in charge. And, again, Jansen wasn’t among them. Very disappointed, I turned away. Jansen had won. “Hang on,” said Sarah. “There are more employees here.” She clicked on another button. “The senior team.” And there in front of us was the woman we knew as Jansen. The woman who had ordered our deaths was smiling at us from the computer screen. Sarah turned to me with a smile. “You were right! Janet Tomkinson is her real name. She’s a senior official at the Department of Trade!” We had identified Jansen at last. But the discovery only made me angry. I felt disgusted, with Jansen and also with myself. Jansen was part of the Government. And it was part of my job to question our Government, to make sure that our politicians behaved correctly. Instead, in my newspaper report the night before, I had printed everything that Dr. Mawle said, without question. I had been so keen to please Sir James that I had stopped acting like a professional reporter. “This doesn’t help us, does it?” said Sarah, looking at the photo. “We still can’t connect her to FCA Systems.” “You heard what David said,” I answered. “It’s ridiculous! But without proof, we can’t run the story. We know what’s happening, and we know who’s involved. But still we have to keep quiet!” And yet, although I was angry, I also knew that David was right. I was a professional, and now the presenter of a major news channel. And professionals do not make accusations without proof. Besides, even if we did broadcast the story, that didn’t mean that we would succeed. Jansen was a powerful figure. And she had already started to destroy the evidence. If I went public with what we knew, I would lose my job. And I would make Jansen all the more determined to kill us. “So what are you going to do?” asked Sarah. “There’s nothing we can do,” I answered. “We haven’t any choice. We have to try to forget about the Mapulans and Bonande. And we have to hope that Jansen will let us live.” I could see that Sarah was relieved by my decision. “OK,” she smiled. “Good luck, Pete.” She gave me a quick hug. “This is what you always wanted.” Sitting at my desk in front of all those cameras for the first time should have felt like a victory. After years of hard work, I was now one of the most important people in British broadcasting. So why did it seem so worthless? And why did I feel so bad? The final broadcast “Good morning, viewers!” I tried to smile, but I felt empty inside. “Welcome to The Enquirer’s live news channel. My name is Peter Booker. We start today with a report from Parliament Square. The world oil crisis continues and, here in Britain, public opinion is strong. We’ll now go live to our reporter on site . . .” The face of our reporter appeared on the large screen behind me. “Thanks, Peter,” he said. “I’m down here in the heart of Westminster, where the crowds are still surrounding Parliament . . .” The reporter continued talking, but I had stopped listening. I felt sick. In my mind, all I could see was so many dead Mapulans. I looked around the studio. David was in the control room at the back; Sarah was sitting by the computer. Behind the cameras, the room was dark. And with the bright lights on my face, I couldn’t see far. But I could see enough to notice a figure standing behind Sarah like a shadow. Whoever it was, wasn’t moving. And then, as I watched, the figure slowly raised an arm toward her head. I should have shouted. I should have screamed. I should have jumped into the darkness and done anything I could to save Sarah’s life. Instead, I froze. I hated myself for it. But I couldn’t move. I watched as the figure stepped closer to her, and closer to the light. I saw her turn, and I waited for the sound of the gun. I was hot with sweat, my body aching. And then Sarah turned toward the front again, and I could see that she was smiling. And now, nearer the light, it was clear; the figure behind her wasn’t a gunman at all, but a studio assistant. At that moment, I felt more disgusted with myself than ever. Whether I broadcast our story or not, we would always be afraid for our lives. I knew that. Until Jansen was caught, we would always be at risk. For those few seconds when I thought Sarah was about to be attacked, I had frozen. I had done nothing. And now was I going to sit and do nothing while thousands of Mapulans were murdered? Was I really going to keep quiet about what I knew, just for the sake of a job? Suddenly, I knew what I had to do. As the reporter continued to speak, I waved for Sarah to come over to my desk. “I need your help!” I whispered. “Pete! We’re in the middle of a report! The camera will be back on you in just a few minutes.” “So just do as I ask. Please!” “What is it?” “Here!” I gave her Kevin Brown’s tape. “Get this ready to play.” “Pete . . .” “Please. I’ll take the blame. I have to do this.” The report from Parliament Square was coming to an end. The reporter was finishing an interview with an energy expert. A few seconds later, he turned back to the camera. “That’s it from here, Peter. Back to you in the studio.” “Thank, John. And now . . .” I hesitated. This was my last chance to just forget about Jansen, and to keep my job. I looked across at Sarah. She nodded—the tape was ready. Behind her, I could also see the studio assistant, looking again like a threatening shadow. “Before we go to the next story,” I said to the camera, “we’ve got more for you on the oil crisis.” “Pete?” Through the wire in my ear, I could hear David’s surprised voice. “What are you talking about? It’s the business news next!” At the back of the studio, I could see him in the control room. He stood up suddenly from his big, black chair. And as I continued, his surprise turned to panic. “We at The Enquirer have discovered that a company here in Britain is breaking United Nations law. It is selling vehicles to the African country of Bonande. That in itself is, of course, not illegal. But hidden inside those vehicles are guns. And Bonandan soldiers are using those guns to murder the people of Mapula.” In the darkness behind the cameras, I could see the cameramen turn to look at each other. They didn’t know what was happening. But, importantly, they continued to record. “Pete?” I heard David’s voice again in my ear. “What are you doing? I told you, I haven’t cleared this story!” I ignored David, and reached into my pocket. Then I nodded to Sarah. She looked nervous but she pressed a button and, within seconds, the screen behind me came to life. And it clearly showed Kevin Brown’s film of the dead Mapulans and the guns as they were removed from the lorry in Bonande. “This tape,” I continued, “was recorded by the journalist Kevin Brown. Just yesterday morning, one day after he returned to Britain, Kevin was murdered in Brompton Cemetery, here in London. He was murdered by the men responsible for selling these guns to Bonande, because they didn’t want this tape to be made public. The tape is proof that they cannot deny. The identity stamps on that vehicle link the lorries to a company in Surrey called FCA Systems. And that’s where the guns are made.” “Pete!” In the control room, David was waving and signaling for me to stop. “We’re cutting to the next story,” his voice shouted in my ear. “You haven’t cleared this with me! I’m taking you off . . .” Suddenly, David’s voice went quiet. I could see through the control room window that he was still shouting and giving orders to his assistants. He was pressing buttons and trying to stop the broadcast. But outside, in the studio, he couldn’t be heard. I looked around. And then I understood why he was suddenly silent. Everything he tried to say and do from the control room had to pass through the computer—the computer where Sarah was sitting. When David realized that he had lost control of the broadcast, I saw him hurry toward the control room door. But he couldn’t open it; Sarah had used the computer to lock them all. She had finally seen the tape for herself, the tape for which she had nearly been killed several times. And now she was nodding at me in agreement. I understood what that meant: I had her support. She knew we were doing the right thing, whatever the consequences. Ignoring the panic in the control room, I looked straight at the camera. Because it was the channel launch, I knew that hundreds of thousands of people around the world were watching—journalists, businessmen, government officials, as well as members of the public. And they were all listening to me. “It’s terrible to discover that a British company is involved in the deaths of so many innocent people. But there’s more to this story than that. The Bonandans are using these guns to take total control of Mapula. The reason? Because Mapula is rich in oil. And President Diallo, the man in charge of Bonande, is using that oil to make a lot of money. But there are others benefiting from so much oil. Our investigation has discovered that the men behind FCA Systems are linked to our own Government.” This time, I could hear the noises of surprise all around the studio. And I could see David clearly through the window of the control room. He was waving his arms as though he was mad. And then he bent down, disappearing from my view. “That’s right, viewers. Members of the British Government are involved.” With the press of a button, Sarah put a picture of the woman we knew as Jansen on the screen. “This woman is one of the principal people behind it. Her name is Janet Tomkinson. She’s a senior official in the Department of Trade. Tomkinson has made a deal with a murderer. She agreed to supply guns to Bonande in return for cheap oil. But the important question is why? Why did Janet Tomkinson and others feel it was necessary to make such a deal?” In the control room, David reappeared. He was holding his big, black chair. And he was preparing to throw it at the window. But I didn’t hurry. I knew that I had to concentrate on the story. I was about to share the truth, and I knew that it would be a difficult truth to hear. “The cost of oil has caused a world crisis, because oil is something that we all rely on. We need it to fill our vehicles and to heat our homes. We need the hundreds of different products that it helps us to create. And because we have had oil—and all the benefits of oil—in our lives for so long, we expect it to continue forever. But the world is changing. Even with the occasional discovery of new supplies, we are running out of oil. And so I ask you all now: what price are you willing to pay to live the same life you have always lived? Ask yourselves what the real cost is of our hunger for oil. Because it might not just be oil you’re pouring into your vehicles or your central heating systems. It might be the blood of thousands of innocent Mapulans.” I knew that my words would be heard all around the world, by hundreds of thousands of people. And I knew then that Kevin Brown hadn’t died for nothing. His tape would be played again and again. It would tell the story far better than my words. “And now,” I said at last, “over to our business team.” The whole studio fell silent as we cut to the business reporter out on the streets of the City of London. No one moved. And then, from the back of the studio, there was a very loud crash as David’s chair fell through the control room window. “Pete!” screamed David. He started to climb through the broken window. “You are in more trouble than you can imagine!” he shouted. “You too, Sarah! What the hell do you think you’re doing?” “I’m sorry, David,” I called, as he charged toward the stage, “but I . . .” “You’re sorry?!” he screamed. “You locked me in the control room! You took over the studio! And you think that sorry makes it OK?!” “I had to do something,” I answered. “We can’t just let . . .” “I told you we weren’t going to run that story. You know that. That’s why you locked me in the control room. For God’s sake! You’ve just accused a senior member of our own Government of doing deals with a murderer! And you’ve no proof at all.” “It’s OK, David,” began Sarah. “No, it is not OK!” he answered, still shouting. “If Janet Tomkinson takes us to court, it could cost us millions! And what’s Sir James going to say?” “If there’s any trouble,” I said, “I’ll take the blame.” “You’re right. You will take the blame, both of you. As of right now, neither of you works here anymore. I want you out of this studio in five minutes, or I’ll call security!” Truth and justice “Cheers!” said Sarah. She picked up her glass of champagne. “I’m not sure I feel like celebrating,” I answered. “After all, we’ve both lost our jobs.” The two of us were sitting at a table by the window in Lazio’s restaurant. It was only twenty-four hours since she had sent me home from her birthday dinner. But now that seemed like weeks ago. “You’re right,” she said. “We don’t have our jobs. But you did the right thing.” I nodded, and we both drank in silence. “Pete, I owe you an apology. I’m sorry. You proved me wrong. You fought for the truth, even though it cost you your job. And that’s a small price to pay for your story.” “Our story. And Kevin Brown’s story.” The Enquirer’s evening newspaper was all about Tomkinson’s arrest. So many people watched the TV report all around the world that it generated enormous public pressure. The police were forced to act. They got legal permission to search both the Department of Trade and the Department of Energy. They found evidence of an agreement with Bonande on Tomkinson’s computer. They also found envelopes of money at her home. And they were still continuing to search the homes and offices of other Government officials. There was even talk that Gordon Macleod, the head of the Department of Trade, was involved. “I saw an interview with the Chief of Police just before I came out,” I told her. “He said he was confident that everyone involved will be caught.” “And meanwhile there are calls for the United Nations to review its policy for Bonande. This could make a real difference to the Mapulans. You did it, Pete! You won!” “We won. We make a great team.” Sarah nodded and smiled. There was a moment of silence. I looked across at her, and I thought about everything that had happened in the last twenty-four hours. “You were right, you know,” I said. “About what?” “About that presenter job. I wanted it so much, but for all the wrong reasons: for the money, the image, and the recognition. I’d forgotten why I became a journalist: to find the truth, for the good of the story—not for my own good.” Sarah smiled. “And now you’ve proved that you don’t need a job like that to reveal the truth.” “On the contrary,” I smiled back. “I’ve proved that a job like that can help to make the truth more powerful!” Sarah laughed. “As long as you’re not afraid of losing the job.” I nodded, still smiling. At that moment, I didn’t care about the job any longer. I had Sarah with me. And that meant that I was happy. And then her cell phone rang. “I’m sorry,” she said. “That’s OK. Answer it, if you want.” She looked at the number on her phone. “It’s David.” I watched Sarah as she listened to David’s voice. She looked as tired as I was. But she was still as beautiful as ever. “He wants to talk to you,” she said. She gave me her phone. “Pete?” I heard David say. “I’ve been trying to contfor hours.” “I turned my phone off earlier this afternoon.” “I imagine it hasn’t stopped ringing since your report. Look, Pete, I got your message. And I’m still not happy about what you did. But I accept your apology. I understand why you did what you did.” “That’s understanding of you, David. And I really am sorry.” “I’ve got someone with me here who wants to talk to you.” A few seconds later, another voice came on the line. “Mr. Booker?” I recognized it instantly. “Sir James!” “Congratulations! You gave our news channel quite an introduction to the world!” “If this is about the legal consequences, Sir James, I’m prepared to take full responsibility . . .” “What legal consequences? You were right! There’ll be no trouble for us, and no trouble for you.” “So you’re not angry?” “Angry?” Sir James laughed. “This is the best possible beginning for the channel.” “What about your cousin? What about Dr. Mawle?” “I don’t know if he’s innocent or guilty,” he answered. “And to tell you the truth, I don’t care too much anyway. If he’s involved, he’ll get what he deserves . . . Look, Pete, I’ll be honest with you. I’m a businessman, not a reporter. I don’t understand everything about news, but I understand about profit. The bigger our audience, the greater our profit. It’s all about image—you have to appear reliable. If people don’t believe what you’re saying, they stop listening. If they suspect for a minute that you’re not telling the truth, they stop watching. But you’ve just made The Enquirer’s news team more believable than any other news provider in the world! Now everyone knows that we’re prepared to reveal the truth—even if it involves my own family! That’s the kind of principled image that money can’t buy!” “So what can I do for you now?” “We want you back, Pete. We’ve had calls from all around the world. Everyone wants to interview you and Sarah. They all want to buy the story. And they all want to show your tape.” “Kevin Brown’s tape,” I said. “Technically, it belongs to ADC News.” “Don’t worry about that. I’ve already spoken to ADC. We’ve made a deal. So what do you think? Will you come back? We’ll increase your salary, of course.” “And Sarah’s.” “Naturally. Well?” I thought for a moment. “I’d want full editorial control. No restrictions.” “You can have all the control you want, Pete. Just as long as you bring me an audience. Now, what do you think?” “I’ll speak to Sarah and call you in the morning,” I said, and hung up. “What was that all about?” asked Sarah. I smiled. “We’ve got our jobs back.” “What?” “Sir James wants us both to lead the TV news team. Increased salary and full editorial control.” Sarah looked at me like she couldn’t believe it. “Pete!” she laughed. “That’s amazing!” Then she saw my face. “What’s wrong?” “You know I’ve wanted this job for a long time, Sarah. It’s everything I’ve ever dreamed of. But there’s something I want more. And I’m not sure that it’s possible to have both together.” “What are you saying?” “Sarah, you know how I feel about you. And I think you still feel something for me. So if it means that we can have another chance, if it means that we can be together like we were before, I’ll turn down Sir James’s offer.” “You’d do that?” “Definitely.” “Really?” “Yes.” Sarah looked down at the table. “I do want us to try again. I think we should. I think we’ve earned it.” “Then I’ll call Sir James,” I said, reaching for the phone. “I’ll tell him now that he can give the job to someone else.” “Wait! I don’t want him to give it to anyone else. I want you to do it. You deserve it!” “But I don’t want it if it means that I can’t be with you.” Sarah smiled her beautiful smile and reached across the table to take my hand. “So let’s do it together. Like you said, we’re a good team. In every way.”

Introduction Why are people creative? Think about the places where the first humans in history lived. We can see art on the walls. We can see drawings of other humans. We can see drawings of animals. Why? Were these pictures a way to communicate? Were they a warning to others? Or, maybe humans just like to create. There is a feeling inside of us all. We want to build something. We want to learn something. We want to try different things. We want to make something new in our world. We want others to see the things we create. And, we enjoy looking at other people’s creations. Being creative lets us tell our important stories. If you write a book, you are communicating to every person who reads your book. Sometimes, we cannot explain our feelings in words. So, we use music or art to show how we feel. Being creative is fun. But, it is also hard work. Sometimes, it can be very stressful if you are having trouble with your ideas. Now, stop and think about the times you tried to be creative. Was it difficult to turn your ideas into a real project? Were you happy with your results? Or, were you sad because you couldn’t get started? Were you sad because you couldn’t think of a great idea? Don’t worry! Even professionals have problems being creative from time to time. Here are ten ways to help you to be creative: 1. Remove distractions Distractions can be everywhere. Your chair is uncomfortable. So, you cannot sit down for long. Then, there are sounds. Sounds come from the people and things around us. Our smartphone lets us know when we have a new message. The television is on. The program sounds interesting. The dog is barking. All of these distractions can stop us from concentrating. We can’t use our creative energy well if we can’t concentrate. Every new idea gets pushed out of our mind by the distractions. We lose our momentum. That is why it is important to remove distractions when you want to be creative. Find a place where you can be comfortable. Turn off your smartphone. Find a place to work that is quiet. However, some sounds can actually help you concentrate. Some people like silence. But, some people like listening to music. Some people say that the sound of people talking in a coffee shop is helpful. To be creative, you should try different things. Find out what works for you. 2. Take the first step Every project, every book, every painting, every building, every song, every creative thing begins with a first step. The first step is often the most difficult of all. Often, we all have the same questions: “Where should I begin? Should I spend more time planning? What if I make a mistake?” But, being creative means being brave. It means making decisions. You must take the first step. In the end, it really does not matter where you start. And, you do not have to get everything right the first time. You can go back and change things. You can change any part and make it better. You can even start again. You can start from scratch. But really, you are not starting from scratch, because you already have a plan. You have already tried once. You will do better on your second try. You will do better because you have learned from your experience. Remember, you can always try again and again. So, you should just get started. You will see, it is easier to work once you get your momentum. After the first step, the second step will become clearer. Then, your creativity will begin to flow easily. You will be surprised at how much you can do, once you start. So, go and get your notebook. Go and turn your idea into a successful project! 3. Set a deadline Have you ever heard of NaNoWriMo? This word means, “National Novel Writing Month.” People from all over the world challenge themselves to write a book in just one month. Why? This is because the deadline makes you focus. It helps you to finish your project. If you have a deadline, you will force yourself to work on your project. You will make the time to do it. Sometimes, creative projects never get finished. They don’t get finished because we may want to wait until we “feel creative” to work on our project. But, the truth is that by setting deadlines, we work harder. We know the deadline is coming soon. So, we work on the project. We work on it more often. And, we work for a longer time on it. We prioritize the project over other things. We prioritize it over other work we have to do. And, we prioritize it over relaxing or going out. Suddenly, we begin to make a lot of progress! Sometimes, somebody will set a deadline for you and your creative work. Sometimes, you can set your own deadline. Having a deadline is like making a promise to yourself. This can have a very strong effect on your creativity. 4. Change your perspective When we have a challenge, we often try to find a different perspective. We often try to find a different way to look at the problem. Sometimes, we need to change the way we look at the problem. Then, we can find the answer. One famous example is of a cup-ramen maker. He thought of how to get the dry ramen into the cup. He kept trying to put a circle of dry noodles into the cup. But, the noodles would never fit into the cup perfectly. So, he decided to put the noodles onto the table first. Then, he put the cup over and onto the noodles. He changed his perspective completely. That is how he saw the answer to his problem. The answer was to turn everything upside-down! If we always think the same way, we cannot get new ideas. Sometimes, we need to change our perspective when we try to be creative. If we change our perspective, we can get a new look at things. Sometimes, this means changing our work space. Sometimes, it means just standing up and walking to a new position. Sometimes, it means pretending to be someone else. Sometimes, it means seeing things upside-down. To get a new perspective, you have to change the way your eyes see. You have to change the way your brain thinks. Then, you will find a new way to reach your goal. 5. Be bored These days, our smartphones are with us every minute of every day. What do you do when you are bored? Do you take your smartphone out and use it? Many people do this on a bus, on a chair, and even on the toilet. We use our smartphones whenever we have free time. Some scientists, however, think that being bored is important. They think it is a very important time for our brains. When you let your brain have free time, it starts to think. It starts to think about everything you have done lately. It starts to make connections between ideas. By doing this, your brain can create new thoughts. This free time for your brain is very important for building creativity. If you always use your smartphone every time you are bored, you are not giving yourself time to daydream. So, the next time you are on a bus, try looking out the window. Don’t use your smartphone. Maybe, you will daydream. Maybe, your brain will use the free time. Maybe, you will think of a new, wonderful idea. Many people say they get their best ideas when they are on the toilet! Some people say the same thing about being in the shower, or the bath. These are places where we can let ourselves be bored. No wonder they are great places for thinking of new ideas! 6. Walk away Being creative requires a lot of energy. You should take mental breaks to help you keep using that energy. If you are writing something at your computer, you could get up and get a drink. You could take a bath. If you are standing and painting, you could go and relax in a comfortable chair. You could go for a walk outside. Or, you might visit a coffee shop. These activities let you get away from your project for a short time. You can relax your mind. You can daydream. Then, you can come back and work on your project with a lot more creative energy. If you do a lot of creative work, you might experience burnout. Burnout means you lose all your creative energy and ideas. Burnout can be difficult. It might take a lot of time for you to feel better. You might need a lot of time away from your work to help you recover. You might choose to go on a long vacation or trip. You might even change your job. When you experience burnout, it is very difficult to be creative. So, you should not work too hard. Avoid burnout by giving yourself time to take mental breaks. You should prioritize your mental health, because that is where your creative energy comes from. 7. Experience things As a creator, your creative ideas come from your experiences. Everything you do in your life becomes a part of your art. Your experiences in your life will influence you. Your experiences will help you grow. Your art will change as you experience more things. So, you should live a life that is full of many experiences. We can look at many artists. We can see that their life experiences influenced their art. One sad, but famous example is Pablo Picasso’s “Blue Period.” The death of Picasso’s friend made him feel very sad. He began to paint his art using mostly blue colors. A few years later, he began to feel better. He started using a lot of pink in his art. Then, art from Africa influenced him. His art changed again. This time he began to use more squares and box shapes. In this way, his experiences helped him to create his famous art. The good and bad experiences in your life will influence your art. Your experiences will influence what you create. Even very small things that you experience may have a big influence on you. And you, or your art, could influence other people and their art. 8. Collaborate When you create something, it can feel very personal. Your creation is something special. It is something you made all by yourself. When you see your finished creation, it can feel very satisfying. That is why many people choose to work by themselves when they create. But, collaborating with other people can be a very powerful way to work. When you combine your creative energy with others, you can create great things. You can create things that no one person could create by themselves. When you collaborate, each person brings their own ideas, experiences, and creative energy to the project. You can find new ways to work. You can learn from each other. You can grow as a creator. And, your creation can become something very special and interesting. Also, when you have a problem by yourself, you may walk away to take a break. But, when you collaborate, the other team members each have their own perspectives. They can try to work on the problem you are having by using different ideas. While you take a short break, they can think of something new. They can keep the momentum going. When you collaborate, your team will think of many ways to be creative. They will think of many ways to get the job done. 9. Challenge yourself Being creative can be fun and satisfying. But, if you do the same thing too often, you will start to get bored. When you get bored being creative, it does not feel fun. That is why it is important to always challenge yourself. When you challenge yourself, you will find new ways to create things. You will make better creations. Each time you try a new challenge, you will learn and grow. After a while, you will see that you are improving with each new challenge. It is very satisfying to look at your old creations and see that you have gotten better. If you start to lose your creative energy, try a new challenge. If you have trouble with one project, try a new one! There are many ways to challenge yourself. Try something that is different from your normal style. For example, if you paint, you could try using different materials. Or, you could try to make some simple art very quickly. If you play the guitar, you could learn the drums. Or, you could try to play together with some new people. The point is to try something new, and maybe a little difficult. You will enjoy the challenge and be more creative. 10. Remember why you create So, why do we create? Everyone’s answer is different. If you are just starting to be creative, maybe you do not have a clear reason yet. You will certainly find your reasons. You might find that the creative process is very satisfying. Or, you might find that showing your work to others is more satisfying. The more you do creative things, the more you will enjoy it. But, at some point, you might start to forget why you enjoy being creative. If people buy your creations, you will probably feel good about it. But then, you might feel like you are being creative only to make money. Being creative might feel like a job. Or, maybe you WANT people to buy your creations, but nobody does! It can feel very sad if no one appreciates your work. At these times, it can be difficult to continue being creative. That is when you should try to remember why you chose to become a creator. Think about why you started creating. Think about how you felt. Your reasons will help you get back your creative energy. In the end, you are creating for yourself. Creating things should make YOU happy. Summary Now, you have read the book, stop and think again. Do you think these ten ways can help you to be creative?

When you create, you speak from your heart to our future.

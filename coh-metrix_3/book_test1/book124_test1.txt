Introduction In life, money is important. We use it to pay for things we need. We use it to pay for things we want. Most of us get money by working. Workers may have one main job or many different jobs. They get a salary every week or every month. Students may get money by doing a part-time job. They may get money from their parents or family. Money, however, is very easy to spend. It can go very quickly. On pay day, people go to the bank. They get their salaries. Then, they pay their rent and bills. They buy food and drink. They go shopping. They go out with friends. But, everything costs money. They return to the bank to get more money. And soon, there is no money left. They have nothing. They have spent all their money. Managing money is a very important skill. We want to make sure that we have enough money to pay for the things we need. We want to make sure that we can buy the things we would like to have. And, we want to make sure we save some money for the future. Now, stop and think for a moment. Do you often spend too much money? Do you always run out of money? Do you have no money saved? Let’s look at ten ways to manage your money better: 1. Make a budget Every month, you should make a budget. Write down how much money you will receive that month. This could be money paid to you for your salary. It could be money given to you from your family. Next, write down all of your monthly expenses; the money you have to pay for the things you need. Your expenses could include money you pay for rent. Your expenses could include your monthly electricity, gas, water, and smartphone bills. Your expenses could include the money you need for food. Your expenses could include the money you need to use the train or bus for the month. After that, decide how much money you want to save. Finally, decide how much money you have left to spend on other things. These are the things you may want to buy or do. Then, every time you spend any money in the month, make a record of it. Keep checking how much money you have left. Keep checking your budget during the month. Remember to keep to your budget. Don’t spend more money than you planned to in your budget. 2. Save often Every month, you should also save some of your money. Look at your monthly budget. Set a goal of how much you can save from your salary. Have two bank accounts. One should be a regular account for everyday use. The other should be a savings account. At the start of each month, put the money you want to save into your savings account. That way, you won’t spend it. Another idea is to save your spare change often. During each month, you will spend money on the things you want and need. You pay for something at a store. Then, you may get some small coins in your change. Have a special box at home. Every time you spend money, put your spare change in the box. At the end of each month, empty the box. Count the coins. You may have a lot! Then, go to the bank. Put the coins in your savings account. At the end of each year, check your account. Ask yourself, “How much money do I have now?” By doing this, you should see your money grow and grow each year. 3. Invest your money Saving money is good. But, we want our money to make us more money. That way it will grow more and more. And, we will have enough money to help us when we stop working at 60- 70 years old. Therefore, it is important to invest some of your money. Talk to people at your bank about safe investment plans. Talk to people who know a lot about good investments. You should invest a small amount of your salary each month. Choose an investment plan that works for you. Choose a plan to invest your money over a long time. It could be a 5-year plan. It could be a 25-year plan. At the end, your investment should make you some money. For example, you invest $5,000 in your first year. Your investment pays you 2.5% interest. You now have $5,125. You add $5,000 to your investment in your second year. You now have $10,125. Your investment pays you 2.5% interest again. You now have $10,378. Keep investing your money. If you make safe and careful investments, your money will grow and grow each year. 4. Have money for emergencies Life is fun. But, we never know what is around the corner. We never know what will happen to us in the future. We may have an emergency. Suddenly, we may need a lot of money. For example, we may lose our jobs and have no money coming in. We need money to pay for things. We may get sick and need to go to hospital. We need money to pay the hospital bills. We may need to move house or apartments. We need money to get a new place. Something important may break. Our car, computer, or smartphone may stop working. We need money to buy a new one. We may need to travel suddenly. Maybe, a friend or family member has gotten sick. We need money to pay for a plane, train, or bus ticket. There are so many things that could happen in our lives. Therefore, we need to save for emergencies. Have a regular bank account. Have a savings account. But, also have an account for emergencies. Every month, save some money in your emergency account. Then, if an emergency happens, you have the money to pay for things quickly. 5. Avoid debt Sometimes, we may spend too much money on the things we want or need. We can spend more money than we have. We may need to borrow some money. We go into debt. However, we will need to pay this debt back in the future. And often, we have to pay interest on the money we borrow. This can cost us even more money. Therefore, it is important to avoid debt. For example, you may want to buy something expensive like a computer. Don’t borrow the money from the bank or store. Instead, save money each month. Pay for the computer in cash. Also, if you have a credit card, be careful! Credit cards make it very easy to buy the things you want or need. You don’t need to use cash. You just need the card. But remember, this is debt. You will need to pay everything back the next month. You will need to pay your credit card bill. If you don’t, the credit card company will charge you lots of interest. Your bill gets higher. And, your debt gets higher, too. Therefore, each month, don’t use your credit card too much. 6. Think before you spend It is very easy to spend money. After all, spending money makes us feel good. But, it is also easy to waste money. Therefore, an important way to manage your money, is to think carefully before you buy something. Ask yourself, “Do I really need this?” If the answer is “no,” don’t buy it. Save your money instead. If the answer is “yes,” then, shop around. Go to many different stores. Check online stores. Find the store that has the best price. Buy it from that store. It is also a good idea to wait before buying something new. After some time, stores will reduce the price. You can get it for a cheaper price. Another thing to think about is quality. For example, you may need to buy some new shoes. You buy some cheap ones. But, after a short time, they break. You need to spend money on another pair. If you spend a little more money on high-quality shoes, they will last you a much longer time. They will provide better value for money. Therefore, when shopping, think about quality and value for money. It is very important. 7. Reduce what you spend Think about what you spend your money on each month. Ask yourself, “Can I reduce what I spend? Can I spend less money?” Maybe, you spend a lot of money on electricity. Think of ways to reduce your electricity bill. Maybe, you make too many phone calls. Try talking to your friends online instead. Your smartphone bill will be lower. Maybe, you buy a coffee or bottle of water from the store every morning. Bring coffee or water from home with you instead. It is cheaper. Maybe, you pay for a monthly magazine or newspaper to be delivered to your home. Maybe, you don’t really have time to read it. So, cancel it. Also, you might be able to read it online or at the library for free. Maybe, when you go shopping or go to a restaurant, you don’t collect the store card stamps or coupons. Start collecting them. Start using them. If you collect 10 stamps, you may get free food. If you use a coupon, you may get 10% off the price you need to pay. These are just some of the ways you can reduce how much money you spend every month. 8. Get money from different places There is a famous saying in English, “Do not put all your eggs in one basket!” If you do, what happens if you drop the basket? What happens if the basket falls to the floor? All the eggs will break. You will have no eggs left. Therefore, in life, it is useful to get money by doing different jobs. Every month, you may get your salary from your main job. But, you could have different part-time jobs, too. Then, if you lose one job, you still get a salary from the other jobs you do. If one job stops, you still have money coming in. You should use the same idea when you invest your money. It is important to invest money in different investment plans. It Is important to invest money with different banks. It is important to invest money in different companies. Some investments may be good. You may get money from these investments. Some investments may be bad. You may make no money. You may even lose money. Have different investments in different places. Then, your eggs are not in the same basket! You will always have money coming in. 9. Donate time and money Managing money is important. We make money. We save money. We invest money. We are also careful about how we spend money. When we do this, we have enough money in our lives. But, what should we do with all this money? Do we just spend it on the things we want and need? Here is another idea. Why not give some of the money away? Life isn’t just about spending money on ourselves. It is a really good thing to help other people. We can help people who have less money than us. In our lives, we should try to donate money. We should regularly donate money to our favorite charities. These charities will then use the money to help people in need. They may also help animals. They may also help people to keep the Earth safe. We can also donate some of our time to help these charities. Instead of working for money, we can give some of our time for free. We can help charities in many different ways. If everybody donates their time and money, we can help the world to be a better place. 10. Be happy with what you’ve got And finally, there may be lots of things that we want to buy. We may want to spend our money on new clothes. We may want to buy expensive bags. We may want the newest smartphone. We may want to get a better computer. We may want to drive a fast car. But, are these things really important? Will they really make us happy? Many people work hard to buy things they really don’t need. They buy things because their friends have them. They buy things because their neighbors have them. They buy things because they see them on TV. They think buying these things will make them happy. They go shopping and spend a lot of money. They feel happy. But, this lasts for a short time only. When they stop feeling happy, they go shopping again. They spend more and more. But, are they really happy? So, take a moment. Think about the things you’ve got in your life. Think about your family and friends. At the end of the day, there is so much more to life than money. The key to a happy life is often being happy with what you have.

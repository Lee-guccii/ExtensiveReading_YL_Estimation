Learning to obey Kanazawa, central Japan, late 16th century As he began his eighteenth run up the steps, Kai wanted to be sick. Across his shoulders he carried two heavy buckets on a long piece of wood and he could feel the blood running down his back where it had taken off the skin. He was crying with the pain and even on this freezing winter day he was wet with sweat. It didn’t seem possible that he could reach the top of the Natadera Steps, but with his teacher Wado watching him from the top of the hill, he had to find a way. He could not— would not—quit. Why eighteen times? he wondered, then tried to push the question from his mind. After all, it was questions that had him running up there in the first place. It had happened like this. Kai and the other young samurai had just finished their afternoon practice, after three hours of sword kata. Kata were patterns of movement that all did to learn the fighting arts, and Kai had practiced them every day since he was old enough to pick up a sword. “You only begin to understand something once you have done it ten thousand times,” his teacher Wado liked to say. Other teachers said “a thousand times” but for Wado it was “ten thousand.” That was Wado, Kai thought. But for a long time Kai had wondered about kata. Did it really make you a better fighter, practicing the same moves over and over again? Kai knew it was important to practice movements many times, but to always practice them in the same order: wouldn’t this make you predictable? To be a better fighter, shouldn’t you practice more fighting? That was what Kai had been thinking, sitting there in the hot bath with his comrades after practice, the snow falling gently around them. When Wado replied, Kai realized he had spoken the words out loud. “Kai, . . .” Wado had said, “only a child asks as many questions as you do.” The other students all laughed. This wasn’t good enough for Kai. Since he’d asked the question he thought he should get a proper answer. “Don’t you think, sensei,” he went on, “that you need to practice real fighting to be a better fighter? Is kata really so necessary?” Everyone went quiet. Arguing with your teacher, even questioning him, was something you didn’t do, and Kai seemed to be dangerously close to doing it. Yet he couldn’t help himself. He was sure he was right. His teacher opened his eyes and looked straight at him. Wado was short, fat, and looked like a frog, and Kai suddenly felt like a fly about to be caught. “Kata is necessary,” Wado told him. “One day you will understand, even if you do not now. Samurai have always practiced kata and they always will. Who are you to question that?” “I’m nobody, sensei, but . . .” Kai hesitated. “But what?” Wado asked. “Surely that just because we have always done it doesn’t mean we should do it, does it?” And that was why he was running up the Natadera Steps, instead of relaxing in a hot bath. Coming to the end now, each foot felt like it weighed a ton. He screamed aloud as he put one in front of the other, forcing himself upward. Just when he absolutely felt he could go no farther, he found himself one down from the top step. He had almost made it. But as he pushed himself up, he almost fell backwards, and Wado had to grab his arm to stop him. His legs were shaking. Wado helped him put the buckets down and placed a thick blanket over his shoulders. Kai tried his best to stand straight, face his teacher, and take whatever was coming. To his surprise, Wado was looking at him kindly. “Sit down, Kai,” he said. Kai had expected Wado to still be angry with him, and so he was confused. He was so tired from the climb, he just stood there for a moment, until Wado helped him sit. “Do you know, Kai, nobody has ever done the Natadera Steps eighteen times?” Kai didn’t know that, but right then he didn’t care either. “You’re a wild one, Kai,” Wado said, as much to himself as to Kai. “Ever since you could talk, you’ve always been the one asking questions, getting into trouble. Why don’t you do things like everybody else?” Kai had wondered the same thing many times. He knew being different was about the worst thing you could be, but he couldn’t help himself. All his life he had been that way. He did things you weren’t supposed to do, said things you weren’t supposed to say, and most of all, asked questions you weren’t supposed to ask. “I just wonder why things are like they are,” Kai said simply. “It seems that things could be better sometimes. I know I shouldn’t think like that, but I can’t help it. I wish I could, but I can’t.” Wado let out a deep breath, as if he’d just eaten too much, and watched the snow fall for a while before he spoke again. “Let me tell you the real reason why we do kata, Kai. It’s not to become a better fighter, not after you’ve learned the basics. Not at your level. You are right about that. We do kata because when we do it, we control ourselves. We control our body, and by controlling our body, we control our mind. By controlling our mind, we are able to obey. You must remember this, Kai. A samurai is born to obey, and if you cannot obey, the world has no place for you.” Wado gripped Kai’s arm hard as he spoke, as if he could make him understand by doing it. Kai knew what he meant—he knew the samurai code as well as anybody. Deep down, however, he wasn’t sure he believed in it. He wasn’t sure what he believed. “The main trouble is you’re bored,” Wado went on, standing up, and brushing the snow off himself. “Things come easy to you. But we’ll fix that, don’t worry.” Wado began to make his way down the steps carefully. Kai watched him go, wondering what he meant. The lord of Kanazawa A week later he found out what Wado meant, when the twelve men in Wado’s company were asked to call upon their lord, Oda Yasunori. Lord Oda was master of Kanazawa and one of the most powerful men in Japan. “It’ll be a fight, probably,” Wado said to Kai. “It’s about time you had one of those, so you’re coming with me. Make sure you wear your best kimono.” After hearing that, Kai hadn’t been able to sit still. It was a few months until his eighteenth birthday, when he would be old enough to join the rest of the men, and so this was a great honor for him. He wished his mother and father were alive to hear about it. A fight, then. He had heard stories of bandits causing problems in the south. Could it be something to do with that? These questions raced through his mind as he waited in the great hall with the other men of Wado’s company. Kai had never met Lord Oda before and had never been inside his castle. The last time he saw him was two months ago, after the death of Lord Oda’s second wife, but that was at a distance, and he realized he didn’t know much about the man at all. The room was silent and Kai took in the men around him. Next to him sat Misaki. Kai knew Misaki a little—everyone did. Misaki was a famous joker, always playing tricks on someone or other. But there in the great hall, even Misaki knew to keep his mouth shut. Why do we have to be silent? Kai found himself thinking. What difference would it make if everyone were speaking? He couldn’t think of one, but he kept his mouth shut anyway. Wado sat in front of them, next to their captain Hironaka. Tall and proud, it seemed to Kai that Hironaka was everything a samurai ought to be. He was dressed in a beautiful, expensive kimono and his hair was as neat as always. He was much younger than Wado, but being highborn he had quickly risen above him. It wasn’t just his birth, however; Hironaka’s name as a warrior was just as good as Wado’s. Kai suddenly remembered a story he’d heard about Lord Oda being angry with Hironaka’s family. Was that why they had all been called there? Kai had imagined that an audience with Lord Oda would mean something good, but now he wasn’t so sure. At that moment a richly dressed man stepped into the room—surely one of Lord Oda’s servants. He kneeled down to one side and spoke in a loud voice: “All bow before Oda Yasunori, twelfth lord of Kanazawa.” The men bowed their heads to the floor. When they rose, Lord Oda was sitting in front of them. He was both fatter and smaller than Kai had remembered—much older, too, although Kai knew he was about the same age as Wado. Perhaps the death of his wife has aged him, Kai thought. Then Lord Oda spoke. “Hironaka,” he began. “We have chosen you and your men for an important duty. Since an appropriate time has passed since Lady Oda’s death, we have decided to take a new wife. Princess Abe of Imahama has been chosen. We would like you to go to Imahama immediately and bring her back to Kanazawa.” “Thank you, my lord,” Hironaka said, bowing once more. “And congratulations. This is a great honor.” “And a great responsibility,” Lord Oda added. “Do you accept it?” “Of course, my lord,” Hironaka replied. “Good,” Lord Oda said, then looked at his servant and nodded. “Naturally, we have not announced the engagement yet,” he told them. “The people will be told as soon as Lady Abe arrives in Kanazawa. Until then, this duty will be kept in total secrecy. Do you understand?” Hironaka and Wado both nodded that they did. “All bow before Lord Oda,” the servant said. Wado’s men were all in high spirits. Their orders meant a couple of weeks out of the city, in fresh air and countryside. Imahama was by Lake Biwa, one of the most beautiful parts of Japan. “I hear the Imahama women are as pretty as flowers,” Misaki was saying. “I wonder if they’ll be in season . . .” “Ah, I’m just glad to be getting out of the city,” one of the others was saying. “It’ll be a change from real work!” Kai wondered about that. Lady Abe’s parents had recently died in a fire, and marrying her would make Lord Oda even more powerful than he was already. Lord Oda had many rivals, men like Lord Fukugawa to the east and Lord Chujo to the south. They were both on friendly terms with Lord Oda, but they would be against the marriage, as Lord Oda would become more powerful than both of them. What if they found out about the marriage? Perhaps they would try to stop it somehow. And then there was the story about Hironaka’s family having trouble with Lord Oda. If this was true, why would Lord Oda give Hironaka such an important duty? “What’s the matter, Kai?” a voice said next to him. It was Wado. “Troubling yourself with more questions? I thought you’d be pleased.” “I am, sensei,” Kai replied. “I really am. And I’m very happy to get the opportunity. I’m just . . . I was just thinking about whether there might be any problems.” “Problems? Such as?” “Can I speak honestly?” Kai asked. He didn’t want to run up any more steps. “Don’t you always?” Wado replied. Kai told him what was on his mind. Wado nodded as he listened. “And what do you think could happen?” Wado asked him. “I don’t know,” Kai replied. “If Lord Fukugawa, say, kidnapped Lady Abe, he could force her into a marriage. Or if she were killed, then . . . ?” “I can’t see that they would kill her,” Wado said. “A kidnapping would be more likely.” “If they knew about the marriage,” Kai added. “Which they don’t.” “Let’s hope they don’t find out then,” Wado said. There didn’t seem to be much else to say to that. Kai pulled his kimono more tightly around his shoulders. The sun had gone down, and it seemed colder all of a sudden. The town by the lake Led by Captain Hironaka, twenty-two men set off for Imahama the following morning. Kai was among them, although Hironaka hadn’t wanted to bring him at first. “He’s too young,” Hironaka said. “Look at him. He’s barely old enough to shave.” That hurt a little. Kai knew he looked younger than his age, and without thinking he moved his hand over his face. “Careful, Kai,” Misaki shouted, as he packed one of the horses. “Your beard might come off if you do that.” The other men laughed, even Hironaka. “He might look young,” Wado explained, “but he’s tough enough. He ran the Natadera Steps eighteen times.” The men carried on laughing, as if Wado was telling some kind of joke. “Nobody has run the Steps eighteen times,” Hironaka said. He seemed angry about it, and looked Kai up and down, as if checking the value of a horse. Wado grinned to himself. “What’s so funny?” Kai asked after Hironaka had left. “What was he angry about?” “He had the old record,” Wado told him. “On the Steps. Seventeen times he did it.” Wado was smiling at him. “Sensei,” Kai began, “why do I feel like I’m in the middle of some sort of game between you and Captain Hironaka?” “A game?” Wado said, walking away. “Why, Kai, I don’t know what you mean.” It took them eight days to march to Imahama. They followed the main road all the way down to Lake Biwa, and then east to the town itself. Kai had never been so far from home before, and he enjoyed every minute of the journey. There were birds and trees he had never seen—even the light seemed different. The sun brightened, and it almost seemed as though they had left winter behind them. Still, Kai was careful. He had not forgotten what he and Wado had talked about. Several times Wado had stopped to show him places where attackers could be waiting for them. Yet hardly anyone else was on the road. It was the time of year, Kai supposed. The other men seemed relaxed—they knew that a group of samurai were a poor target for bandits—and behaved as if they had nothing to fear. They all joked with Kai about how young he was, but by the time they got to Imahama, Kai felt accepted by them, even by Hironaka himself. They arrived in the town of Imahama early in the afternoon. Some members of Lady Abe’s household had come down from the castle to meet them and take them to the inn where they would spend the night. As he walked through the town, Kai’s first thought was how tidy everything was. The streets and shop fronts were clean, and the trees and bushes were well kept. It was quiet, too, perhaps unnaturally so for a place of its size. Kai wondered why. Hironaka had given the men the rest of the day to themselves, so as soon as Kai arrived at the inn he went straight to sleep. Hours later, he was woken up by some shouting, and he hurried out of his room to see what was going on. It was his comrades. They had taken over the dining hall and were yelling at each other. Misaki was in the middle of one of his stories. Kai recognized it right away; he had told it only a few days before, when they had made camp one evening. The others didn’t seem to care; they were all red- faced, laughing and shouting. “Kai!” Misaki shouted. “I was just telling the story about the time I woke up in a stable in Kobe . . .” “When you thought the horse was a priest and asked it to pray for you?” Kai asked. Misaki opened his mouth in shock. The men laughed again. “Misaki!” one of the other men shouted. “Your stories are getting old. You need some new ones!” “Ah, the old ones are the best,” Misaki said, finishing his cup and pouring another. “Sit down, Kai. Have a drink.” “I need to talk to Wado-sensei first. Do you know where he is?” “No idea,” said Misaki. “With the captain, maybe? They went out together a while ago.” Kai nodded and went outside. The street was empty, except for one or two shopkeepers packing up and an old man cleaning the front of his inn. He heard voices from the back: it sounded as if someone was trying to talk quietly but was too angry to manage it. Was it Wado? It certainly sounded like him. Knowing he shouldn’t, he went down the side of the inn to listen. “I must strongly protest,” Wado was saying. “This decision is wrong. It’s totally wrong and it will put us all in danger.” “How dare you question me, Wado?” Hironaka replied. “How dare you! Lord Oda instructed me to bring the Lady Abe to Kanazawa as quickly as possible. And that is what I intend to do.” “Captain, we cannot take the same road back. There are so many places we could be attacked. At least a dozen. If Lord Oda’s enemies . . .” “Nobody knows about the marriage, Wado. Can’t you get that into your head?” “It’s too much of a risk,” Wado said. “If we are attacked . . .” “If we are attacked, then we will fight!” Hironaka shouted, so loud Kai was sure everyone must hear. “Do not be such a baby, Wado! We take the highway tomorrow morning, and that is final. Do you understand?” There was a moment of silence before Wado spoke. “I understand,” he said. One of them started coming toward him. Not wanting to be found, Kai ran back into the inn, sat down at the table, and called for an extra cup. After a few moments Wado came in and sat next to him. “Sensei,” Kai said, offering him a drink. “Kai,” Wado replied. “You’re a little pink. Enjoying the night air, were you?” “No! I mean, I went for a walk earlier, but . . .” “What did you hear?” Wado asked him quietly. Kai thought about denying it, but decided against it. “Not much,” Kai replied. “I mean nothing at all, really. Just that Hironaka wants to take the same road, and you disagreed, but he wouldn’t listen.” “It’s easy to say that nobody knows about the marriage,” Wado said. “But there are a thousand ways people can find out. Especially when you are as rich as someone like Fukugawa. It’s such a risk, taking the highway. Captain Hironaka is proud—it’s almost as though he wants a fight. I’ve got a very bad feeling about this.” Kai didn’t quite know what to say to that. His teacher wasn’t often wrong. Wado picked up his drink and nodded at Kai’s cup. “Better drink that, Kai,” Wado said. “If I’m right, it might be the last you ever have.” Lady Abe The next morning, Kai woke late with a headache. He picked up his things, grabbed some rice at the inn, and ran up to the castle. The other men were waiting in front, along with the palanquin and the men who were going to carry it. They would carry Lady Abe all the way to Kanazawa. A big crowd of local people were standing around. What are they doing here? Kai asked himself. Nobody is supposed to know about this. The sky was gray and there was an unhappy mood about the place. Only Misaki was unaffected. Kai couldn’t hear what he was saying, but from the quiet laughter of the men around him, he guessed he was into another one of his jokes. “Quiet,” Hironaka told them. “Sorry, Captain,” Misaki replied, continuing when the captain’s back was turned. Kai’s head hurt as he thought about the night before. Was Hironaka really blind to the danger? Certainly the captain was better known as a fighter than a strategist. As much as Kai wanted to test himself, he knew Wado was right: especially now, seeing the whole town there, they had to take a different road. He tried to catch his teacher’s eye, but Wado was deep in thought. As he was thinking about what he could do about it all, his mind suddenly and completely went blank, because Lady Abe appeared on the steps of the castle. Until now, Kai had not really thought about the kind of woman Lord Oda had chosen as a wife. He imagined some cold woman of middle age, who would sit in the castle all day like the previous Lady Oda had done. Therefore, the woman in front of him, the girl, took him completely by surprise. Not that she was a typical beauty, by any means. She was tall and slim, but rather broad across the shoulders. Her face was a little too round to be called beautiful, and her nose and mouth a little too large. But not a single man spoke as she came down the steps. When she smiled at the crowd around her, she seemed to catch Kai’s eye, and he felt as though his heart would stop. Lady Abe turned to Hironaka and bowed. “I will say a few words, and then we can go,” she told him. “As you wish, Lady Abe,” he replied, and the crowd became quiet as she faced them once more. “People of Imahama,” she began. “It gives me great pleasure to see you all here this morning. It would have touched my mother and father to see you pay your respects in this way. Yet I am sorry that many of you appear upset about my leaving.” She paused for a moment and took a breath. Kai was surprised to see some people in the crowd were crying quietly. “I will miss all of you,” Lady Abe went on. “And it is hard for me to leave—this is my home, and I will always think of it that way. But we should not be sad; this is a happy time, for all of us. I go to be married, and to a life of happiness with my new husband. And you, the people of Imahama, my people, can look forward to a new friendship with the people of Kanazawa. So thank you, all of you, for your kindness over the years.” Lady Abe bowed then. Kai was surprised, and so were his comrades. An old man stepped forward, presenting a small, wooden box to Lady Abe with a deep bow. “Please accept this,” he began, speaking carefully, “from all of us, as thanks for your kindness, and the kindness of your family, over the years. It’s only a small thing, but I hope it will bring you a little pleasure in the days to come.” Lady Abe took the box and bowed again. She opened it, and Kai saw that inside there was a small wooden model of a man and a woman: he guessed it was Lady Abe’s mother and father. For a moment a strange look passed over her face, as if she were about to cry herself, but it went as quickly as it had come. “Thank you,” she said. “I will treasure it always.” The old man stepped back a few steps. “Kneel!” he shouted, dropping to his knees himself. Behind him, everyone kneeled. “Bow!” he shouted, and everyone bowed. Lady Abe’s servants helped her into the palanquin and they began to march out of the town. Kai wondered what Lady Abe was thinking as she sat inside her palanquin. Was she really happy that she was getting married? What a strange was, he thought. He had never known a lord or lady to be so close to their people. Normally princes and princesses saw their people only as mouths to feed and hands to farm the land. What kind of princess bows to common people? Kai wondered. He looked back as they went through the town gates. The people of Imahama were still on their knees. Lady Abe had a number of servants with her, including two ladies and a company of warriors. All of the Kanazawa men were fascinated with Lady Abe and made Lady Abe’s men smile with all their questions about her. Kai was surprised nobody seemed to notice how unhappy she was. She was polite, even friendly, to Captain Hironaka when he had reason to speak to her, and was always calm and composed. But he could see underneath there was a lot of pain, and that understanding made him feel strangely close to this princess from the south. Wado, also, had been in a terrible mood. Kai knew it was to do with his argument with Hironaka, and hoped again that his sensei had been wrong. He had hardly spoken to Kai, except to tell him to watch the woods over here, or the hills over there. He did so again, as they entered Tochinoki Pass. “It’s going to be here,” Wado said, moving up the line of men. “Watch yourselves.” After two days of warnings, Kai was starting to think that Wado had been wrong. The pass was heavily forested, but it was such a beautiful morning that it was difficult to imagine anything bad happening. The other men must have felt the same, because they walked lightly, talking and joking with one another. It seemed impossible that violence could come on such a day, yet just as he was thinking it one of the men screamed. Up the line, one of his comrades lay on the ground with an arrow in his chest, his legs kicking out wildly. For a moment, Kai couldn’t work out what had happened, but then more arrows came flying out of the woods and everything was confusion. They were being attacked. Tochinoki Pass There was no cover on the road, and the men were easy targets. More arrows flew out of the trees. Some of the men threw themselves to the ground. Others looked around, unsure what to do, were hit and fell screaming. Kai lay flat on the ground. Next to him, someone was dying. The man sat, trying to push himself to his feet with one hand, trying to pull an arrow from his chest with the other. It looked as if he was about to get it out, but then his legs kicked out and he fell backwards and didn’t move. What was his name? Kai thought, but couldn’t remember. Someone grabbed his arm. “This way, boy!” Wado shouted, and began pulling himself across the ground towards the palanquin. Kai followed. He couldn’t see the rest of his men, but Lady Abe hid behind the palanquin with one of her maids. The other lay bleeding on the grass beside them. It was hard to move, Kai found, as though his arms and legs were frozen. He imagined an arrow would hit him any second but then he was behind the palanquin, and Wado was pulling him up off the ground. Lady Abe’s mouth was set in a hard line. A cry came from behind them. It was Hironaka, running toward the enemy in the trees, his sword raised above his head. A group of survivors ran behind him, Misaki one of them. Kai’s heart filled with their bravery. He wanted to charge with them, but anyone could see they had no chance. Wado’s face was cold. He shook his head. Misaki was one of the first to die. After the first arrow hit him in the chest, he managed to keep running. A second hit him, then a third, and he fell. Kai shouted curses, his eyes filling with tears of anger. How could Misaki, whose life was to joke and make people laugh, die like this? Only Hironaka made it to the woods. Kai listened for the sound of Hironaka’s sword, but there was only a single cry of pain and then nothing. “There must be at least twenty in there,” Wado said, mostly to himself. “He had no chance.” There were three other Kanazawa samurai with Kai and Wado, and along with Lady Abe’s men there were nine in all. It wasn’t enough. Kai couldn’t take it all in. “We have to get to the horses,” Wado said. The two animals were back along the road. Kai hadn’t noticed they were still there, and was surprised. “We don’t have a chance while they’re in the trees,” Wado went on. “Not with their bows.” “We will follow your lead,” one of Lady Abe’s men said. “You men!” shouted one of the enemy. “You have no chance here. Send her out and we’ll let you go.” Lady Abe opened her mouth to speak but Wado cut her off. “He’s lying,” Wado said. “They’ll kill us anyway. We don’t have much time. When they come, we’ll run that way.” He pointed in the direction of Kanazawa, away from the horses. “Toward the trees over there. You,” he went on to one of the girls, “will be in the center. We will make them think you are Lady Abe.” She looked surprised, but in their traveling kimono there wasn’t much difference between her and Lady Abe. Kai began to see the plan Wado had in mind. “What will I do?” Lady Abe asked. “You go with him,” Wado replied, gesturing at Kai. “Sensei, surely you . . .” Kai began. “Do you have a better plan?” Wado asked him. “No, but . . .” Kai began. “Then obey!” Wado said. “Thank you, all of you. I will never forget this,” Lady Abe said. “Wado-sensei,” Kai began. He could feel tears coming and didn’t want anyone to see, so he bowed. “Kai, listen to me,” Wado said quietly. “Stay off the road. Do whatever you must to survive. Use your mind, Kai. Do you understand me? Use your mind. Now, we go!” In a circle around Lady Abe’s servant, the samurai ran out from the palanquin and west towards the woods. A great cry came out from the trees on the opposite side, and enemy warriors charged out. They were screaming their war cries, running toward Wado’s group, their swords above their heads. Kai hid behind the palanquin, slowly moving around it. There were at least twenty samurai in the chasing group, and they were gaining fast on Wado and the others. “Are you ready, Lady?” Kai asked. She nodded once in answer. Moving slowly and low to the ground, the two of them made their way to the horses. Kai calmed the animals, then began to remove the packs from their backs. “There! By the horses!” It was one of the enemy samurai, carrying a spear. He ran down the road toward them, yelling to his comrades. “Give me your knife,” Lady Abe said. Kai passed it to her and she began to cut some of the packs free. Kai was struggling with the other, but the samurai would be on them before he could finish. Already some of the others had seen them. Kai drew his sword and stepped forward. The man charged, seeing only a boy in front of him, attacking with the point of the spear. Kai was already moving. He stepped to the side and cut down hard. His enemy managed to avoid the sword, but the movement left him off balance. Kai didn’t wait. He pushed forward, slicing upwards. The man cried out, falling, and swung his spear desperately as he died. It caught Kai’s side, but he had no time to think about it—two other swordsmen were almost upon him. Kai got ready to meet them. “Come on!” Behind him was Lady Abe on one of the horses. “With me, come on!” she shouted again. Kai turned and jumped up on the horse, behind her. The chasing samurai yelled in anger. “Go! Let’s go!” Kai shouted. Lady Abe kicked at the horse and they set off fast down the road. Kai looked back. About half of the enemy were chasing them; the other half were fighting with a lone samurai. It was Wado. He was wounded, with many men dead around him, and Kai could see he had no chance. He wanted to jump down, to run back and fight with him, but then one of the enemy samurai cut Wado from behind and he fell. Kai cried out. He wanted to jump down from the horse and charge the men, although he knew it would achieve nothing but his death. Wado’s words came back to him. “Obey,” he had told him. So he obeyed, pushing the tears from his eyes. There would be a time for tears later. Now he had to stay alive. Into the woods The two of them had a good start, but they only had one horse. Kai knew that their enemies must have some horses too, and as soon as they got on them, Kai and Lady Abe would be in trouble. “We have to get into the trees, Lady Abe,” he said. The road in front of them went over a hill. If they cut into the woods, perhaps the enemy would think they had gone straight on, and it would give them some time. Thankfully, there was no snow on the road. They might have a chance. “We’ll be safe back in Imahama,” Lady Abe replied. “They’ll expect that,” Kai told her. “Into the woods, I beg you.” “Here,” she said, moving aside and letting Kai take control. He turned into the trees and immediately wondered if he had made a terrible mistake. The ground was uneven and icy, and he held his breath in terror of the horse falling. But somehow it kept its balance and made its way into the forest. They had not gone very far when they heard horses charging down the road. As the enemy samurai passed, Kai could hear the men yelling at their horses to go faster. He knew he had been right to get them off the road, but he also knew they were not safe yet. Soon the men would know they had been tricked and begin searching the woods. He pushed the horse deeper into the forest. The trees were thicker there and the ground less even. Their horse started to struggle, so Kai got down to lead it on foot. He pressed on that way for hours, ignoring the growing pain in his side and trying to stop himself from thinking about Wado, Misaki, and all the others who had fallen. He knew Lady Abe was doing the same. Every time it got too much he would stop and turn to her. “Are you well enough to continue, Lady Abe?” he would ask her. “I am, thank you,” she would reply. All the time he listened for their enemies, but the sound he feared did not come. Soon it was nightfall, and Kai found a small clearing in the woods to make camp. As he turned toward the horse, his foot slipped, and he fell to the ground with a crash. “Are you all right?” Lady Abe asked him. “I’m fine,” he replied, sitting up against a tree. “Let me see that,” she said, gesturing to the wound in his side. Ignoring his protests, Lady Abe opened his kimono and looked at his wound. Her face was calm, as always. It didn’t seem right to Kai that a highborn lady would bother with the troubles of a lowly samurai, but nothing about the situation was right. He was too tired to protest, in any case. “You should have told me about this before,” she said. “Forgive me, Lady Abe,” he replied. “Keep still,” she told him. Lady Abe took some snow from a nearby tree and pressed it against Kai’s side. Using a piece of cloth she began to clean the wound. Kai tried not to look at her, and fixed his eyes on his wound instead. It wasn’t bad and Kai knew he had been lucky. He felt like he should say something. Wado had taught him many things, but he hadn’t taught him how to speak to a princess. He cleared his throat. “Thank you so much, Lady Abe,” Kai said to her. “I am honored by your kindness.” Lady Abe looked up at him. She gave him a funny look— for a moment it seemed as though she was smiling. “Did I say something funny, my lady?” Kai asked. “No, not at all,” she replied. “Just that if we’re going to get through this, we might need to relax a little. What’s your name, samurai?” “Kai Tesshu, my lady,” he replied. “I will try. To do as you ask, I mean.” “You saved my life, Kai Tesshu,” she told him. “Now let me help you.” She found some cloth in one of the remaining packs on the horse and tied it over his wound. Kai didn’t want to risk a fire, but with the cold he knew they had no choice. Lady Abe helped gather wood, then they sat in front of the fire and ate some dried fish and rice balls. There was enough food to last them a couple of days if they were careful. Plenty of water too, but not much else. Kai had found an arrow sticking out of a pack. If it had hit the horse, they’d have been down for sure, and that would have been the end of it. “Who were those men, do you know?” Lady Abe asked him. “I’m not sure, my lady,” Kai said. “But my sensei, Wado, thought there was a good chance of an attack.” “Wado, the man who . . . ?” Lady Abe asked him. Kai nodded. “I’m sorry for your loss,” she said. “He wanted to take a different road back to Kanazawa. In case someone wanted to attack us. He thought perhaps Lord Chujo or Lord Fukugawa would try it. He had many arguments with Captain Hironaka about taking a different road.” Kai wasn’t sure he was supposed to talk about that, but it didn’t seem like it mattered much now. “My people only knew about my wedding a day or two before we left,” Lady Abe told him. “From what you say, those men that attacked us must have known before that. They must have seen you on the road coming down.” Kai nodded. What Lady Abe said made sense. If someone had betrayed them it must have been someone closer to her, or someone from Kanazawa. The only thing he knew was that it couldn’t have been any of his comrades, as they all lay dead back along the road. He was too tired to think about it any more right then. His mind went back to the fight, seeing his friends die and cutting down his enemy. The man must have died, Kai thought. His first kill. It didn’t seem like anything, now that he thought about it. When he thought of Misaki and all his other comrades, he only wished he could have killed more of them. They sat quietly, gazing into the fire. Kai felt the warmth in front of him, the coldness behind, and the coldness made him think of death, all around them. The road They moved through the forest for another day and night. Kai’s side began to feel better, but the problem was they were moving so slowly. There was little food, and the ground made it hard going. He thought they might take their chances on the road, at least for a while. Kai hoped their horse would move better on the road, but it wasn’t to be. The horse was still exhausted from their escape and was walking strangely. Kai guessed it had injured a foot in the forest and wasn’t sure how much farther it would take them. He was also worried about other travelers. Anyone seeing Lady Abe would surely remember her, and though they had not met anyone so far, he was nervous about it. He explained all this to Lady Abe. “Perhaps we could change kimono, and I could pretend to be your servant,” she replied. “My lady?” Kai said, his face reddening. “I wasn’t being serious, Kai,” she replied. “Wait here.” Lady Abe went into the woods and did not come back for some time. Kai began to worry and was about to try to find her, when an attractive but messy young woman came out of the trees. “What do you think?” the woman asked. Kai could only stare. Lady Abe had wiped all the makeup from her face, and her hair hung freely around her shoulders. She had taken off the top coat of her kimono, showing only the plain cloth underneath, which she had rubbed with dirt from the forest. She had put some of the dirt on her face and hands, too. More than that, she seemed to be carrying herself differently. She was more relaxed, more . . . natural. Kai realized he was seeing, perhaps for the first time, her true face: the face of the young woman, rather than the lady of Imahama. And somehow she was even more beautiful. His breath caught in his throat. “Well?” she asked again. “Will it do?” “It will, my lady,” Kai replied after a time, and though he couldn’t be sure about it, it seemed as if Lady Abe reddened before she looked away. After that, she insisted on walking next to him. When he considered their dirty faces and feet, and rough-looking clothing, Kai realized how much they looked like a young samurai couple who had fallen on hard times. It might not fool their enemies but it would be good enough for anyone else. Still, it was strange walking next to her. He had never even met a high-born lady before, let alone one as young and beautiful as this. “Remember, try to be relaxed with me,” she said. “It will be easier for us both if we can forget our positions.” “I am trying, my lady,” Kai replied. They soon passed a family heading south. Kai wanted to ask for news, but he didn’t want to draw any attention to them, so he simply exchanged hellos and continued on. The family paid them little attention. As they walked past, Lady Abe was smiling. “Is everything all right?” Kai asked her. “Nobody knows I’m a lady—they think I’m just like them,” she said. “It’s wonderful.” Kai laughed, and she laughed with him. It felt like a strange thing to do after all that had happened, but he couldn’t help himself. “Tell me about Lord Oda,” she asked him. “What kind of man is he?” “I’m not quite sure how to answer that, Lady Abe,” Kai replied. And he wasn’t. That he’s a feared leader? Or that he’s short and fat and looks old enough to be your grandfather? “He’s a strong man,” Kai said. “A strong leader. All the men respect him. He’s a wise general. One time, he . . .” “I’m not talking about that,” she interrupted. “I know all that. Is he kind? That’s what I mean. Is he handsome?” “I couldn’t say much about that,” Kai replied, reddening. “Oh,” Lady Abe replied. She thought about it for a while. “Tell me about yourself, then, Kai. Do you have a family?” “There’s not much to tell. My parents are both dead.” “Oh, I’m so sorry . . .” “That’s all right. It was a long time ago. My father was a samurai, like his father. My mother came from a fishing village near Kanazawa.” “What about you, Kai? Are you married?” “I’m not, no,” he said. “You must have a young lady, then?” she asked. “No, nothing like that,” Kai replied, his face reddening. “What, no one at all?” He shook his head, his eyes lowered. “I see,” she said. “Sometimes I wish I . . .” “Quiet!” Kai said. He had heard something. Dropping down, he put his ear to the ground and listened. It was distant, but clear: the sound of fast-approaching horses. “We have to get off the road, now!” He pulled the horse off the road and toward the trees. The side of the road was covered with snow: there was no way not to leave a trail. Still, he couldn’t worry about that now. Lady Abe was pulling at the horse. They had just got it into the cover of the trees, when two riders came over the rise. Enemies, Kai was sure of it. He could feel his heart beating hard in his chest and he held his breath as the riders came toward them. Would they see the trail and stop to search? Kai couldn’t see how they could miss it. But somehow the riders went straight by. By pure luck, they had escaped. “That was close,” he said. “I’m sorry,” Lady Abe replied. “That was my fault.” “It’s all right,” he told her, but he wasn’t sure it was all right. The enemy hadn’t seen them this time, but they were on their trail and now stood between them and Kanazawa. Warmth in the night “This is no good,” Kai said. “We’re too slow. If we’re going to get out of this, we’ll need fresh horses.” “Where are we going to find fresh horses?” Lady Abe asked him. Kai shook his head. After they rushed off the road, Kai had decided to rest the horse and think about what to do. Somehow or other, they had to get past their enemies, and ride straight for Kanazawa, except he wasn’t sure now where their enemies were. If he were the enemy, what would he do? He imagined he would put men along the road, at places that he and Lady Abe would have to visit. But where would those be? When he asked himself this question, his mind kept coming back to the river. On the way down to Imahama, where they had met Lady Abe, they had to cross the Kuzuryu River by raft. It was wide and fast-flowing, and with very few points to get across. That would be the perfect place to trap and attack them. A trap, yes. That was certainly their enemies’ style. The more he thought about it, the more he thought there would be men waiting for them at the river. He couldn’t be sure, but it was the best guess he had. And the river couldn’t be far away now: no more than a half day at their current pace. Their enemies would expect them to run, he thought. They wouldn’t expect them to go on the attack. This gave Kai an idea. It had a small chance of success, he knew, but a small chance was better than no chance at all. They approached the river late in the day. Kai took the horse and went on ahead, to see what he could find. As he drew closer to the river, he left the horse in the woods, and continued on foot through the trees. About 100 meters from the river, he stopped. Smoke was rising from one of the small hills above the river. Men were up there, and he was sure they must be their enemies. By the time he got back to Lady Abe, night had already fallen. “Did you find them?” she asked. “I think so,” he replied. Kai’s plan was to attack at first light, so the two of them made their way through the forest in the dark, tripping and cursing at every step. When they finally reached the hill, Kai realized he’d missed something. “We won’t be able to make a fire,” he said. “We could freeze.” “Then we’ll have to keep each other warm,” Lady Abe replied. Kai’s voice caught in his throat. “My lady?” he said. “Let’s find somewhere dry,” she replied. It didn’t take long to find some dry ground, under a large tree. Kai took a blanket from the horse and placed it on the ground. Lady Abe rolled up another as a pillow, then lay down, making herself comfortable. Kai stood for a moment, then lay down behind her. “Put your arms round me,” she said. Kai did as she asked. She pulled herself backwards, closer to him. He could feel her warmth. She was right: they would get through the night together. He closed his eyes, though he did not think he would sleep. This is something, Kai thought. What would Wado say if he saw me now? But Wado was gone. Kai had lost both his parents, but they had both died when he was very small, and he did not remember them. He realized Wado had been like a father to him. The thought of never seeing him or speaking to him again was hard to take. And not just Wado: Misaki and all the others. Even Captain Hironaka. All gone. A great sadness struck him then, and he felt it might break him, but his anger was too strong. He would find out who was behind the attack and make them pay. Wait a minute, he thought. Have you lost your mind? If someone like Lord Chujo was behind the attack, what could he do? The answer was nothing. He could do nothing. What had Wado said to him, after he had run the Steps? A samurai is born to obey, and if you cannot obey, the world has no place for you. He understood that now very well: the lord’s place is to give orders. The samurai’s to obey them, even if it means his death. That made him think: why not give Lady Abe to their enemies? They wouldn’t kill her after all. But they’d kill you anyway, came his answer. And where would he go? If he went back to Kanazawa without her, he imagined Lord Oda would probably want him dead. But that wasn’t the real reason, he knew, thinking of the woman in front of him, and suddenly realized she was crying. “Lady Abe?” he asked. “Are you all right? Are you cold?” “Did I disturb you?” she replied. “Please . . . go back to sleep.” “I was awake. Please don’t bother about that. Is there anything I can do?” Time passed, and Kai wondered if she wouldn’t reply, but then she spoke. “My mother used to hold me like this when I was a little girl. It made me think of her.” “Oh, I’m sorry. Shall I move?” “No, no. Please don’t. It’s just that I miss her so much, Kai. And then I started to think of her death, and all the death I’ve caused, and I wonder how I can live with it.” She turned to him, her eyes full of tears. “I feel that I’ve caused all this death. Of your friends and your sensei. My servants. My friends. Perhaps it would be better if I were dead!” “No! You mustn’t say that.” “It’s so mixed up, Kai. It’s all terrible and unfair.” “I will protect you, my lady. Whatever I can do, I will do.” “Listen to me,” she said, taking hold of his kimono. “If I go to them, you’ll be able to go free. You can go back. You . . .” “Lady Abe, please don’t ask this of me. I cannot do that. I will not.” She held him tightly then, and spoke very quietly. “Please don’t die, Kai. If you were to die, protecting me, I . . .” “I won’t, I promise,” he replied, although whether or not he could keep that promise, he didn’t know. Fresh horses At some point in the night Kai dropped off to sleep, and he awoke to find Lady Abe shaking him. “Kai,” she said. “It’s time.” He tied his belt, put on his swords, and grabbed a rice ball from the pack. “Be ready,” he said to her. “Be careful,” she replied. He nodded back and began to go up the hill. It took about thirty minutes to climb it, and day was breaking when Kai found the enemies’ camp. One man stood watching the road. He was lost in thought, Kai saw, and knew that gave him a chance. Kai drew his sword, came out from the trees and went forward as quietly as he could. As he approached, he saw the other men. There were five of them, all asleep, their horses tied to a nearby tree. A path ran down the hill toward the river. They don’t expect me, Kai thought. Perhaps this might even work. He drew closer to the man, holding his breath and trying to keep his sword hand steady. He wanted to rush him, but knew he could not. At any second he could turn round, and all would be lost, but Kai kept moving forward, no more than six steps away, then five, then four. He tightened his grip on his weapon. The man blew on his hands, then turned round and looked directly at Kai. For a moment, he just stood there with his mouth open, too surprised to shout out. Not for long, but long enough to ensure his death. Kai jumped forward and struck. It was a killing blow. Kai reached forward to catch the man as he fell, to bring him down quietly, but slipped as he did so. They both went down together, and Kai silently cursed as they fell to the ground. Somehow, the man had fallen on top of him, covering him in blood, and Kai had to free himself before he could get to his feet. He was certain he’d woken the other men up, that it would be the end for him, but somehow they were all still asleep. Kai moved over to the first sleeping man with his short sword ready. He could kill him, all of them, easily. But something stopped him. He thought of Wado and his dead friends, willing himself to do it, but still he could not. It is weakness, he told himself, weakness that stops you. But whatever it was there was nothing he could do about it. He went over to the horses instead. They were nervous, from the smell of blood, he guessed. He tried to calm them, and had just freed the second one when he heard the cry. “Someone’s here!” the man yelled. “Wake up!” “Ogita’s dead!” another yelled. One of the men picked up his sword and ran towards Kai. Without thinking, Kai jumped up onto one of the horses. Holding onto another, he charged down the hill. He yelled at the horses to go faster, ignoring the poor light, and charged down the hill. Lady Abe was down by the road, waiting with the pack horse. She looked shocked when she saw him covered in blood. “Are you hurt?” she asked, breathlessly. “Get on!” he yelled back. She jumped onto the back of the second horse and together they raced down the road towards the river. As they came closer, Kai had a sickening thought: The raft—what if it’s on the other side? He let out a shout of relief when he saw that it wasn’t. They jumped down from the horses and began to move them onto it. Getting the horses onto the raft was painfully slow. Kai glanced down the road, waiting for the enemy to appear. He struggled with the rope, his hands shaking badly, as Lady Abe did her best to keep the horses calm. Finally he gave up, drew his sword, and cut the ropes through. Then the enemy samurai appeared, charging down the road toward them on their horses. Kai pushed the raft free and started across the river. Safe! We’re safe! Kai thought. It was only when he saw one of the men stringing a bow that he realized he was wrong. A bow! How could he have forgotten they had bows? The raft was so slow-moving, it would be no trouble to shoot him full of arrows. There was nowhere to hide— no cover on the raft at all, except the horses. Yet if the horses died, then so would they. There was nothing he could do. “Bring the lady back, and we’ll give you an honorable death,” one of the samurai shouted. “What do you know about honor?” Kai screamed. They were so close, so close to getting away. Kai wanted to cry with anger and his own stupidity: he should have killed them all while he had the chance. “Come on, boy,” said another. “You’ve done well. Don’t make us kill the horses.” The bowman took aim, and Kai closed his eyes, but then Lady Abe stepped in front of him, holding her arms out to the side. “Lady Abe,” Kai said, “what are you doing?” “Please, my lady,” one of the samurai shouted, “we don’t want to hit you.” But then suddenly Kai understood, and so did the men on the bank, who started to yell in anger. “What kind of man are you, hiding behind a woman’s skirts?” they shouted. “Coward!” “You men are the cowards,” Lady Abe shouted back. “You will all die for what you have done!” Kai didn’t like hiding behind Lady Abe either, but he could see this was the only way to get out of the mess. His heart filled at her bravery: Kai had killed their comrade, and he knew there was a chance they would still take the shot. He wanted to stop her, but then the man threw his bow onto the ground in anger and so he concentrated on getting them across as quickly as he could, to whatever waited for them on the other side. The hunt They left the horse on the other side of the river. It was struggling, and Kai knew it would not keep up the pace they needed to set. He hoped their enemies would treat the animal kindly, but he did not believe it. It was hard to say good-bye, but there was no choice. They took the last of the dried fish from its pack, enough to get them through the morning, then rode north as fast as they could. Both of them knew there was a chance they would run into their enemies on the road, but they had agreed to risk it. They had only a little food left, and there was always the danger that the horses would get hurt in the forest, so they made for Kanazawa as quickly as they could. There were fewer trees on the other side of the river. As they pressed north, the woods thinned out, and the snow lay in spots on the ground. It was silent except for the horses and the dry sound of their breath. He turned to look at Lady Abe beside him. She was bent over her horse, her eyes narrowed against the wind, her hair streaming behind her. As he looked at her, what he felt most was pride. Being with this woman made him proud. There was something else, too, but that feeling he could not quite admit. They passed other travelers in the valley but paid them no attention. Kai had been sure there was an inn along the road and wanted to spend the night there. He thought it worth the risk, but as afternoon drew on he hadn’t found it, and he realized the horses would soon need to rest. Though she had not said anything he could also sense Lady Abe tiring, so he decided to make camp. He guided his horse off the road and up onto a small hill. It had some trees for shelter, some grass for the horses, and would give them a view of the road. “Good idea,” Lady Abe said, climbing down. “I’m ready for something to eat.” “Let’s see what there is,” he said. His stomach complaining, Kai lifted the packs from the horses and began to search through them. He found tools, spare clothing, and blankets, even a bag of money, but no food. “No . . .” he said in disbelief. He searched the other pack, but it was much the same. Kai realized that when they camped for the night, the men had probably taken the food out of the packs to eat it. He suddenly felt stupid, although there was nothing he could have done. He could stand an empty stomach, but they had another day’s hard riding tomorrow, and they needed the energy. “I’ll hunt something,” he announced, with more confidence than he felt. He took the bow from a horse and began to string it. The problem was that while Kai knew how to use a bow, he had never been a good shot. To make matters worse, he had only hunted once or twice in his life. “Are you sure?” Lady Abe asked him. “I’ll do my best,” he replied. “I will come,” she said. “Really? You don’t need to tire yourself, my lady.” In response, Lady Abe turned to unpack one of the enemy’s bows from the horse. She couldn’t quite manage it, and Kai had to help her. This is going to be good, Kai thought to himself. Riding through the valley Kai had noticed some birds higher up in the hills, and so he decided to go after them. They had not been walking more than ten minutes when he came upon some wild turkeys, about a hundred meters away. He couldn’t believe his luck and began to move toward them. “Not that way,” Lady Abe said. “Why not?” Kai asked her. “The wind. We might disturb them if we go that way.” “Ah,” Kai replied. “Of course.” They went around in a wide circle, coming upon the turkeys from the side. When they were about thirty meters away, Lady Abe spoke again. “Here,” she said. At first, Kai didn’t know what she meant. “I’m sorry?” “Here,” she said again. “Take your shot. If we get any closer, they’ll get nervous and run.” “Of course,” Kai said again. He was starting to worry Lady Abe could see he didn’t know what he was doing. She sounded like she knew a lot more about hunting than he did. But hit a turkey from thirty meters? Was she joking? Putting the thought out of his mind, he took careful aim at the nearest one, trying to take the wind into account. The turkey was fairly still at least, and Kai focused on it with all his being, all his energy. He drew his hand back with his breath, held it for a moment, and then let f l y. The moment the arrow left his hand, Kai was sure it would find its target. And it almost did. But just before it struck the turkey, a light wind moved it gently off course. It hit the ground no more than a hand’s width from the bird. The turkeys ran off up the hill. So close! Without thinking, Kai put his hand to his side, where he had been injured, his face showing the pain of his failure. “Oh, bad luck!” Lady Abe said. “Is it your injury? It must be your injury.” Kai couldn’t be sure if Lady Abe was surprised he had missed, or surprised he had gotten so close. And though he never wanted to use his injury as an excuse, it didn’t seem like such a bad thing. “It was insensitive of me,” she went on. “It must be difficult to use a bow in such pain.” “It is a little difficult,” he said. “May I try for the next one?” she asked. “My father taught me to shoot a little. I don’t have much skill, but it will give you a short rest, at least?” This didn’t sound like a good idea to Kai, and there were only a couple of hours of daylight left. But he knew he’d been lucky to get as close as he did, and if he kept trying they still wouldn’t get any dinner. “Of course. Please,” he replied. He wasn’t sure, but it looked as if Lady Abe smiled. This time she took the lead up the hill, following the trail of the birds. Soon they came upon another group, and about forty meters away, Lady Abe stopped. “Perhaps a little closer,” Kai suggested. “I will try,” she replied. Oh, dear, Kai thought. Kai’s face reddened as Lady Abe opened the front of her kimono and removed one arm from it entirely, so that her shoulder and arm were bare. Despite her advice about the wind, Kai had been sure she’d have difficulty just drawing the bow. But in one smooth movement Lady Abe took aim, drew back the arrow, and let fly at the target. The arrow lifted in the air. She’s overshot it, Kai said to himself with some relief. Just as I thought. For a moment it looked as though he was right, but the arrow dropped at the end of its flight and took the turkey in the middle of its body. The animal dropped soundlessly, the others running in all directions. Kai stared at Lady Abe, openmouthed. “Can you cook?” she asked him. A princess and a woman To Kai’s amazement, Lady Abe insisted on preparing the turkey, and he watched her out of the corner of his eye as he added wood to the fire. Her arms were bloody and her hair fell around her shoulders. Even pulling the insides out of a turkey, she was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. She caught him watching her, and her face lit up in a smile. “Don’t look at me while I’m doing this,” she laughed. “It’s too horrible!” Was it being highborn that made Lady Abe so special? he wondered. He thought not. She would be special wherever and however she came into the world. Why couldn’t she have been born a samurai, like me, then? Kai wondered, then quickly pushed the thought from his mind. That was fate, and there was nothing you could do about that. You want her, a voice in his mind said. Tell her you love her and ask her to run away with you. Again, Kai pushed the thought out of his mind. It was madness, and he knew it. Did Lord Oda know what kind of woman she was, what kind of person he was marrying? Probably not, Kai knew. As soon as the wedding was over, Lady Abe would be locked up in the castle for the rest of her life, just like his other two wives had been locked up. Kai wondered if she knew what kind of life was in store for her. She must, he told himself. He bit his lip. There was a pain inside him, and, as they got closer to Kanazawa, it would only grow worse. “Is something wrong?” Lady Abe asked him, sitting down next to him. She had washed her hands and now the two of them placed the turkey on a stick over the fire. “Not at all,” Kai replied. “I was just thinking.” “Oh,” she said. She could sense how he was feeling, he knew. He excused himself to look for more wood, even though they had plenty already, hoping it might lift his spirits. It didn’t. When he returned to the camp, he felt just as bad as when he had left it. He sat by the fire and poked at it with a stick. The turkey was almost ready and smelled delicious. That was something, at least. “Are you thinking about Wado and the others?” Lady Abe asked him. Kai hesitated and then nodded. He could hardly tell her the truth, he reasoned, but immediately felt guilty about it. “That and the journey ahead,” he added. “We will get to Kanazawa, Kai,” Lady Abe said. “You think?” “I’m sure of it. I can feel it. You will find a way.” “Me? Well, if we’re lucky I will,” Kai replied. “Can I tell you something?” Lady Abe said. “Please.” Kai wondered what it was. “Back at Tochinoki,” she began, “when Wado told you to go with me, I almost refused you. Please, don’t look so shocked. It was just your age. I thought it would be safer with a more experienced man.” “I see,” Kai said, quietly. Was he such a disappointment to her? “I can see why he chose you now,” she went on. “You aren’t like other people. Other men. How many men on their own would try to steal horses from the enemy? You can think for yourself. You’ve got spirit. And you are brave. Can I ask you something?” “Of course.” “Why did you leave the men on the hill alive?” Kai was surprised. How did she know that? he wondered, so he asked her. “You wouldn’t have been able to steal the horses if they’d all been awake,” she replied. “I’m guessing you killed one and left the others alive. It would have been safer to kill them, but you didn’t. Why?” “I don’t know,” Kai said, and he didn’t. “Fear, perhaps.” “I don’t believe that, although I would believe it of other men. You’re different, Kai. It’s hard sometimes, isn’t it?” Kai nodded. “Not many people could have got us this far. You must remember that.” “It wasn’t just me,” Kai said. “You saved my life on the river. Besides, without you, we’d have no dinner.” She laughed then and Kai laughed along with her. What did it matter if she knew he couldn’t shoot? “You’re more of a swordsman than a hunter, then,” she said. “I knew! I knew from the way you were going straight toward the birds on the hill! And then, ‘It does still hurt a little.’” She said it in Kai’s voice, and it sounded strangely like him. They both laughed until there were tears in their eyes. Soon the bird was ready and Kai cut pieces from it with his short sword. It was delicious. They sat and ate in silence for some time, then Lady Abe spoke. “My father was such a kind man. He always said I should have been a boy. He said it was because I would have made a great leader, but I think it was really because he knew the life of a lady is so dull.” “I’m sure you would have been a great lord,” Kai said. “Anybody could see how much the people of Imahama love you.” “It’s kind of you to say,” Lady Abe replied. “When I was young, he would pull me out of my dance or music classes, and take me to hunt and fish instead. It used to make Mother so angry. But my father, he always encouraged me to be free. He told me the thing that made him most sad was that one day I would get married and that freedom would end. That day’s nearly here, isn’t it?” There was little point in denying it, Kai thought, and he nodded. “It’s terrible to think this with everything that’s happened, but I wish I . . . No, I can’t say it. I should stop. I shouldn’t be speaking like this.” “It’s all right,” Kai said. “Please, say what you want.” But she didn’t. She was silent for a while, gazing out at the snow. There were tears in her eyes, and they shone in the fire light. Suddenly, to Kai’s surprise, she smiled. “I love the snow this time of year,” she said. “In April. It becomes more beautiful, when you know it won’t last for much longer. Don’t you think?” “I do,” he said gently. “My first name is Yuki,” she said. It meant snow. Of course, thought Kai. “I always asked my father why I was named that and he told me that one day I would understand. I think now I understand.” Lady Abe sighed. She was sitting close to Kai now, and he wanted to take her hand and tell her everything would be all right, but he couldn’t. “Would you do something for me?” she asked. “Would you say it? My name?” Kai knew that a line was in front of him, that if he went over it, there was no going back. But he could feel the wildness in him, and could do nothing to stop it. “Yuki,” he said softly, and then because it seemed the only thing to do, he kissed her. Newlyweds They rode hard all the next day. In the morning they hadn’t spoken about what had happened the night before, but as they packed the horses, and began to make for Kanazawa, there were occasional glances and smiles between them that hadn’t been there before. Later, as they drew closer to Kanazawa, they saw more travelers on the road. Yet there was no sign of any of their enemies. It would be another day before they were home, but Kai knew they would be difficult to catch now. His heart was heavy with the thought of what would happen when they arrived, but he put it out of his mind as best he could and tried to think only of getting there. As it was getting dark, a light snow began to fall again, and they came upon an inn. It looked inviting. Kai slowed his horse as they passed, considering it. Was it worth the risk? Probably not—they’d be much safer in the woods—and yet . . . He decided to leave it to Lady Abe, who brought her horse up next to him, as he had known she would. “Let’s stay here tonight, Kai,” she said. “Is this place fitting for a lady like yourself?” he asked her. She began to laugh. “The forest would be more suitable, I suppose. Or the top of a hill.” “It’s a risk,” Kai added. “Do you really think they’re still after us?” “They’d have to be desperate,” he replied. “I’d say we’re more likely to run into men from Kanazawa. Who knows?” “Let’s risk it,” she said. “We’ll need some sort of cover,” Kai said. “There’ll be other people there, wanting to know this and that. There always are at these places.” “We can say we’re newlyweds,” Lady Abe suggested. “You are Kai Tesshu, so I will be Kai Yuki. We’re returning home to Kanazawa after visiting my family.” “What about our dirty clothes?” Kai asked. “We don’t exactly look like newlyweds.” “We were attacked by bandits,” Lady Abe said. “I’m not sure,” Kai began, but it was too late—Lady Abe was already going through the door. As he stepped inside, Kai immediately relaxed. It was warm and comfortable, and something delicious was cooking. Uchida, the woman who kept the inn, offered them a bath and gave them both fresh kimono to wear. “How wonderful!” Uchida had said when Lady Abe introduced them as having just been married. She had a bright round face and a healthy smile. Kai liked her instantly. “We’ll have to make them something special for dinner,” her husband shouted from the kitchen. After they took a bath and were in clean dry kimono, Kai felt like a new man. Lady Abe had washed and arranged her hair. Though she wore no makeup and her clothes were simple, Kai could not imagine her looking more beautiful, and his heart turned over when he saw her. The two of them went to the dining room to eat, where Uchida brought them some food. She served them some fish, then brought a large pot of vegetable stew to their table. It was all delicious. “I hope you don’t mind me saying, but you’re such a beautiful young couple,” Uchida told them. Kai realized he was grinning. The inn was almost full now, and most of the guests were interested in Kai and Lady Abe. He ought to be looking for enemies, he knew, but it was difficult when everyone was looking at them. “When did you get married?” Uchida asked them. “Two weeks ago,” Lady Abe replied. “Oh, that’s wonderful,” Uchida said. “Anyone can see how much you’re in love.” Kai reddened at that, and noticed Lady Abe did the same. “You say you were attacked by bandits?” one of the guests said. “That’s right,” Lady Abe said. “Just a few days ago.” “On this road?” “On this very road,” Lady Abe replied. “Isn’t that awful?” Uchida shook her head. Everyone in the inn agreed that it was. “Still, you’re safe now, and that’s what matters,” another guest added. “You didn’t lose much, did you?” “We were lucky,” Lady Abe said. “My husband managed to fight them off.” “You are so lucky to have found a man like this one,” Uchida told her. “So brave like that. And so handsome!” Kai reddened as she turned to him. “And so are you, young man—there aren’t many girls like this one.” “I know,” Kai replied. “I wish this moment would last forever,” Lady Abe told him quietly when Uchida had gone. “So do I,” he replied. “Tesshu, I . . . There’s something I must ask you. Something I want you to do. Want us to do.” She took a deep breath. It was as if she couldn’t say it. Kai’s heart beat uncontrollably. “Oh, my,” she said, getting up. “Would you wait a moment?” Kai wanted to stop her, make her tell him what it was she wanted to ask him, but she was already away. His hands shook, because he could guess, or thought he could. If she asks you, he said to himself, if she asks you to be with her and run away together, what will you say, Kai? He didn’t need to think about it. The answer was yes. Yes, he would run with her, as far and fast as they could, and sometime, somewhere they would find a place that had never heard of Lady Abe, or Lord Oda, or even Kanazawa. He was sure that’s what she was going to ask him, he was certain of it, but he never found out because just at that moment, Captain Hironaka walked into the inn. Back from the dead At first Kai didn’t recognize Captain Hironaka, because his face was dirty, his clothes were torn and bloody, and his hair was wild. Hironaka’s dark eyes searched the room and landed on Kai. Kai could only look at him, openmouthed as Uchida tried to show Hironaka to a free table, but the captain waved her away and came straight over. Kai got to his feet. “Captain . . .” he said, bowing deeply. “Kai,” Hironaka said to him, putting a hand on his shoulder. “I’m glad you’re alive.” “Captain, I saw you die,” Kai said to him. “Did you? You wouldn’t be the first to think so. Still, it was close. I was lucky, that’s for sure. Lady Abe . . . she’s safe?” Kai nodded, trying to take it all in. Captain Hironaka alive? They were safe, then, finally. But with that thought came another: now they were surely going back to Kanazawa. The same shock was on Lady Abe’s face. She had come from the bathroom and stood disbelieving behind the captain. He sensed someone was there, and bowed deeply to her. “Lady Abe, I’m so happy to see you well,” he said with a great sigh. He then looked at Kai again, and his face darkened, as if noticing how clean and fresh they both looked. Kai was waiting for him to say something about it, to ask why they weren’t riding as hard as they could for Kanazawa, but instead Lady Abe spoke. “Captain Hironaka—you’re alive.” She was as lost for words as Kai. By now everyone in the inn was interested in the strange front of them. “We thought you were . . .” “Dead? Well, I can see why. I almost was, I suppose.” “You weren’t even wounded?” she asked him. “Here,” Hironaka said, putting his hand to his right side. “A spear. I was very lucky. But not as lucky as you two. I hear half of Fukui has been looking for you.” Fukui was Lord Chujo’s land. So was it Lord Chujo who was behind the attacks? Kai wondered. “How did you survive?” Hironaka went on. “It was Kai,” Lady Abe said quietly. There was little expression on her face. Kai could see how she felt. Distant, disbelieving. Their time was at an end, and she knew it. Hironaka nodded to him. “The young hero,” he said. “You have done very well, boy, and I’ll make sure Lord Oda knows it.” Kai bowed as Hironaka turned back to Lady Abe. “If you have the strength for it, my lady, we should leave immediately. The enemy could arrive at any time and we would be no match for them. We have to get you back to Kanazawa.” “You want us to ride through the night?” Kai asked. “We have to, yes,” Hironaka replied. “Please, gather your things and let’s be away.” Uchida came over to Kai. “Is everything all right, master?” she asked. “Everything’s fine,” Kai said, giving her a few coins. “It looks like we won’t need the rooms after all.” Lady Abe looked at him, as if to ask what to do. He ignored her, his mind racing. Everything was all happening so quickly and he had a strange feeling in his chest. Was it from the thought of losing Lady Abe, or the fear that Hironaka suspected something. Or was it something else? The feeling in his chest tightened and Kai realized he knew the answer. “Are you sure you’re all right, sir?” Uchida asked once more. “It’s cold out, and it’s started to snow.” This time it was Hironaka who answered. “We’re all fine here, woman,” he said. “Stop getting in the way and make sure our horses are ready.” Uchida hurried away and Hironaka began to make his way to the door. Lady Abe started to gather up her clothes then saw Kai hadn’t moved and stopped. “Kai?” she said. “Stay,” Kai told her. Hironaka had stopped and turned back to the table. “Is there a problem?” he asked Kai. “I think so,” Kai said quietly. “Well, what is it?” Hironaka asked him. As a reply, Kai threw his cup at Hironaka. It hit the captain on his side, before shattering on the floor. “How dare you?” Hironaka shouted. “Doesn’t it hurt?” Kai asked him. “What?” “You said you were injured there,” Kai repeated. “So I’m asking you, doesn’t it hurt?” Hironaka put his hand to his side, finally. “And you said ‘our horses,’” Kai went on. “But you didn’t know we had horses. You couldn’t have known. Just like you couldn’t have fought your way out of the forest.” Hironaka sighed, his hand moving to his sword. “Captain Hironaka,” Lady Abe said, “I demand that you leave here immediately and . . .” “Be quiet,” he said. “Kai, I see you are as clever as Wado thought. Good for you. So you must know there is no way for you to escape. There are other men outside.” “You’re a murderer,” Kai said. “And a coward.” “Please,” Hironaka said. He seemed impatient. “You know nothing. And all you need to know is that I am taking Lady Abe, and you will die here tonight. The only question is how.” “I challenge you,” Kai said. “So be it,” said Hironaka, and went out into the darkness to wait for him. April snow Kai was heading for the door, pushing his two swords through his belt, when Lady Abe grabbed his arm. “Please, Kai,” she said. “Don’t fight him. Run. Now. I’ll go with them. I’ll stop them somehow, slow them down. Please, Kai.” There were tears in her eyes. She knew as well as Kai that the only thing that waited outside for him was death. “I have no choice,” Kai told her. “You do! Kai, you can run. Go, out the back now. Nobody will think less of you. I won’t think less of you. Please, Kai. Nobody will even know.” “I will know,” he told her, then took her hand. “You were going to ask me something,” he said to her. “In the inn. Please tell me what it was.” “Don’t go outside, Tesshu, please.” “I have to,” he said, and stepped outside. Hironaka waited near the road. Two other men stood next to him, both of them wearing the enemy’s kimono. Hironaka’s hands rested easily on his belt. He looked relaxed. And with good reason, thought Kai. He was one of the most famous swordsmen in Kanazawa. The snow fell gently around them. Hironaka stepped forward. Kai was about to move to meet him, when he felt someone behind him. It was Lady Abe. “Go back inside,” he told her. “I will not,” she replied, quietly. “Send over the woman and I’ll give you a quick death,” Hironaka shouted. Kai shook his head and slowly drew his sword. “As you wish,” Hironaka replied and in one smooth, almost lazy, movement, he drew his own sword and stepped back into his fighting position. Even from this one simple movement Kai could see Hironaka was the better warrior. He thought fast, looking around in desperation, but saw nothing that could be of any help. “Leave that boy alone!” Uchida shouted. The old woman stood in front of her inn with the other guests behind her. “We don’t want any trouble here.” “Be quiet, woman,” Hironaka said. “I’ll burn this place to the ground if you open your mouth again.” They all went quiet, and Kai knew he could expect nothing more from them. To say anything else would be to invite death. “Please!” Lady Abe shouted. “Let him live, and I’ll come with you. I’ll gladly come with you.” “I am sorry, Lady Abe,” Hironaka said, keeping his eyes on Kai. Hironaka began to circle to his right, away from Kai’s sword arm, forcing Kai to move in the opposite direction. After a few moments, Kai realized Hironaka was moving him onto rough ground, where it would be more difficult to balance. He tried to think. If he let Hironaka move him further to the right, he would soon be in deep trouble. There was only one thing to do: he pressed forward, hoping to control the distance. Hironaka had expected this: he jumped forward, slicing with his sword. It was so fast Kai’s eye barely saw it. Somehow he managed to throw his own blade up, blocking the blow as he jumped to one side. It almost knocked his sword out of his hand. Hironaka pressed again, this time striking to the left. Kai managed to get out of the way but his legs were heavy. It was as if they were freezing up with fear, and he could feel his sword hand wanting to shake. “I can smell your fear, boy,” Hironaka said to him. Kai didn’t trust himself to reply, so he kept quiet. “Just like your master Wado.” Kai tried to keep the anger from his face. “It’s to be expected, I suppose,” Hironaka went on. “It can’t be easy, knowing your sensei was a coward. Did you know he begged for his life?” Kai knew Hironaka was lying, trying to make him lose control. The thought calmed him: if Hironaka had to play these games, maybe he wasn’t so sure of himself after all. Kai wasn’t just fighting for himself now, or for Lady Abe: he was fighting for his master, and for all the men of his company who lay dead and betrayed. But just as Kai had this thought, Hironaka struck again. This time Kai was slow, and Hironaka’s sword left a cut in Kai’s side. He hardly felt it but his legs suddenly felt weak and he knew it was bad. Lady Abe cried out. He needed an advantage, fast. Use your mind, Wado had told him. But how? Hironaka was faster, and more skilled, that much was clear. But was he tougher? Kai remembered the Natadera Steps, and what Wado had said to him about kata. “We do it to learn to control ourselves,” Wado had told him. It gave him an idea. A crazy, impossible idea, perhaps, but there was no room for any other kind. Hironaka attacked again. Kai brought his sword up to block it, but a little more slowly, and Hironaka cut him again, this time on the arm. Kai was breathing hard. He attacked, swinging wildly, and Hironaka blocked easily, bringing his sword across Kai’s chest. The cut was deep, and Kai’s head felt light. He could hear Lady Abe crying. He stepped back, dropping his head. He planted his sword in the ground for balance, using it like a walking stick, to keep himself from falling. Hironaka’s men began to laugh. “Really, Kai,” Hironaka said. “I expected better from Wado’s top student.” “Please!” shouted Lady Abe. “Don’t kill him!” “I must,” said Hironaka. He walked over to Kai, lazily swinging his sword to knock Kai’s sword away from him. It was a careless move, as Kai had guessed it would be. Hironaka had thought Kai was finished, yet he wasn’t, not quite. As Hironaka swung, Kai turned in a tight circle and brought his sword down across Hironaka’s shoulder, cutting deeply into him. Hironaka fell, dead before he hit the ground. There was a moment of silence, then his men yelled in anger and astonishment. Kai barely heard them. Wado-sensei, he thought to himself, you can rest now. He suddenly realized he wanted to do just that. Blood poured from his side and chest. Everything was moving very slowly. He suddenly wanted to be sick, and felt his legs give way under him. It’s not so cold now, he thought. Funny I never noticed that before. He heard a distant scream and turned his head to see the other two samurai charging down at him, their swords raised. Kai thought of Lady Abe. Now is your chance, he wanted to say to her. Run. Run for your life. He looked up toward one samurai, but he had stopped, frozen like Hironaka had frozen. He looked strange, and Kai realized there was an arrow sticking out of his neck. How did that get there? Kai wondered. Then the other one fell behind him, and after that it wasn’t the samurai charging him at all, but Lady Abe. She threw down her bow and put her arms around Kai. Her face was wet with tears. “Kai,” she shouted. “Kai, please stay with me.” “Lady Abe . . .” “You must hold on,” she said. “You have to. Don’t you understand? You can’t go. There was something I wanted to ask you, Kai. Do you remember? I said I wanted to ask you something when I got back. I wanted to ask you to run away with me, Kai. To run away from everything, from all this, somewhere where nobody knows us. Just the two of us, Kai. Will you? Will you come with me?” Kai smiled. “Of course I will,” he said quietly. “I promise.” He wasn’t sure she’d heard, but he was glad she had asked her question finally. There had always been so many things he wanted to know, but lying here he realized that was the only thing that still mattered to him. Lady Abe began saying something else then, and Kai couldn’t hear, but it didn’t matter. What mattered was they were going to be together. They would find a place where it was warm and get married and have lots of children. Yes, that’s how it would be. He looked up at Lady Abe again. She looked upset, and he wanted to tell her not to be, that everything was all right. She was so beautiful, he thought. There was a light in her like he had never seen before, but he could see it now, more clearly than ever. It shone out of her, and all he wanted to do was look at it, but the light was too much even for him, and it burned his eyes, so he closed them. Epilogue The lady of Four Lands Lady Abe opened the curtain of her palanquin and looked out at the old inn by the side of the road. Its landlord and staff kneeled in a line in front of it, as they did every year when she passed by on the way to visit her home town. Normally, she would sit here in her palanquin for a few moments before continuing with the trip, but this year was different. She was old and knew this year’s journey would be her last, and so she had a different plan in mind. She enjoyed the feeling of the cold air on her face and waited. Sure enough, after a few moments came the sound of footsteps on the path, and the face of her son appeared at her window. “Are you sure about this, Mother?” he asked her, his face pink in the cold air. She smiled. What a fine young man she had for a son. He was so tall and handsome, and she was so very proud, although she was careful not to tell him this too often. “Don’t be in such a rush,” she said to him. “And yes, of course I’m sure.” Her son shook his head. “Mother, I feel I should remind you in case you’ve forgotten in your old age, that I’m the lord of the Four Lands and you are my noble mother. While this . . .” he said, pointing at the inn behind him, “. . . is a common inn. We’re going to give the poor innkeeper a heart attack if we stay here.” “He’ll be fine,” Lady Abe said, thinking back. “He had a strong mother.” “Is that so?” her son replied with a smile. “I think we should just continue on, personally.” “Help me down,” she replied. Her son may well have been the lord of the Four Lands, but he knew better than to argue with his mother, Lady Abe knew. Holding her son’s hand, she stepped down onto the snow. The hundred samurai of their guard all kneeled around her. Her maids ran up, looking worried. “Is there some problem, Lady Abe?” one of them asked. “You will get cold out here in the snow.” That made her smile. Nobody here knew of the night many years ago, when she had kneeled out here in the snow trying to save the life of a dying man, the only man she ever loved. As she walked slowly to the inn, her mind went back to that terrible night. Kai had won but the fight had cost him his life. Lady Abe had wanted to go mad with the pain of it, but there was something else in her that was stronger, and that was the desire for revenge. So when the riders from Kanazawa arrived the next day they found the lady of Imahama to be a cold-faced and stone-hearted young woman. She had been married to Lord Oda within a week of reaching Kanazawa and, very soon after, announced she was going to have a child. Lord Oda, who had found his new wife to be a cold young woman, was delighted by the news, yet he fell off his horse a month before her son was born and never lived to meet him. So it happened that Lady Abe became the Lady of Kanazawa, ruling the region in place of her son. What a struggle it was, trying to keep power after her husband’s death, but Lady Abe found that her father had been right when he said she would have made a good leader. Somehow she had gotten the other nobles on her side and as soon as she had, her mind turned to revenge. She never did discover whether it was Chujo or Fukugawa behind the attack, so in the end she decided to destroy both of them—first Chujo, then Fukugawa—and added their lands to Kanazawa’s power. This was how her son became the lord of Four Lands, her son who was now explaining to their servants that they planned to spend the night in a roadside inn. The innkeeper almost did have a heart attack when his servants explained the situation, but luckily, the sight of some gold had brought him back from the dead. Now Lady Abe sat drinking tea with her son while the samurai checked that the building was safe. “Now will you tell what we’re doing here, Mother?” her son asked her. “Because, my boy, for a very short moment a long time ago this was the place I was the happiest in all my life.” “I don’t understand,” said her son, whose first name was Tesshu. “You don’t understand because you don’t know the story of how I first came to Kanazawa.” When she saw her son was about to speak, she put her hand up to stop him. “The real one, I mean. And since I don’t have very long to go, I thought it was about time you heard it.” “Don’t be silly, Mother,” Tesshu said. “You’ve got plenty of years left.” “Well, possibly,” she replied, knowing it wasn’t true. “Now do you want to hear it or not?” “Of course I do!” he said. Her son didn’t want to believe the doctors, she knew, but Lady Abe could feel the pain growing inside her and knew it wouldn’t be long. But that was all right, she thought. Her son would be fine—he’d had a strong mother, after all. And soon she would see if Kai had kept his promise, whether they could really find a place where there were only the two of them, where they could get away from everything else and be together. Lady Abe smiled as she thought about it—she had been waiting all her life for it, after all. Before that, however, she had one last duty: to tell her son the truth about his mother. “What are you smiling at, Mother?” Tesshu asked. In answer, Lady Abe took another drink of her tea, collected her thoughts, and began her story.

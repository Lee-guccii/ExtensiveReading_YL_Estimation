Introduction In life, most people need to work. We need to work to get money to pay for things. But, after school, do we just get a job? Or, do we look for a career? A career will pay you money, too. However, it is different to a job. A career may be long term. It may be something you don’t really like doing. You may find it difficult to get up every morning to do it. In your job, you may do enough work to keep your boss happy. But, maybe you don’t want to do extra work to improve yourself. You just do your job for the money. Also, there may be little chance for you to develop your skills. There may be little chance to grow. A career will pay you money, too. However, it may be long term. It may be something you really enjoy doing. And, you enjoy working every day. You may do many different things to learn important skills. And, you may work hard to get more and more experience in your career. You work hard to get better and better. You want to develop yourself. And, you may have many opportunities to move up the ladder. You have opportunities to grow. Now, stop and think for a moment. Are you a student? Have you decided what you want to do after you graduate? Or, are you not sure about what to do next? Are you working a job you don’t really like? Do you want to change it? Do you want to find something you will really enjoy doing? Let’s look at ten ways to help you choose your career: 1. Assess yourself Think about yourself. Make a list. Write down the things that you enjoy doing (e.g. Talking with friends; playing sports). Write down the things that are important to you in life (e.g. I want to make a lot of money; I want to help other people; I don’t want to work evenings and weekends.) Write down things about your personality (e.g. I am shy; I am creative; I am serious; I am helpful). Write down the things you are good at doing (e.g. I am good at math; I am good at teaching people to do things; I am good with computers.). Read the list. Then, think about what careers may be a good match for you. There are many free self-assessment tests on the Internet, too. These tests will ask you many questions about yourself. After you finish answering each question, each test will suggest careers that may be a good match for you. Do a search online for “career self-assessment tests.” Choose several different self-assessment tests to do. Make a note of the careers that they suggest. Then, think about yourself again. Do you agree with the results of the tests? Doing different kinds of self-assessment activities may help you when choosing your career. Choose your Career 2. Talk to family members and friends about what they do Many people can get interested in a career because of a family member or a friend. There are many examples of sons and daughters that follow what their parents do. So, when thinking about your future career, a good starting point is talking to your family. Talk to your father. Talk to your mother. Talk to your older brother or sister. Talk to aunts and uncles. Talk to friends who work. Find out about their careers. Find out exactly what it is they do. Find out what they like most about what they do. Find out what they dislike, too. Have them describe to you a typical day at work. Think about whether this is a career that you would like to do. Does it match your personality? Does it match what is important to you? Is it something you would be good at doing? If you are interested, find out more about how they got started in the career. Find out what skills and abilities are important. Find out what qualifications are important. Find out what people need for this kind of work. Choose your Career 3. Research the careers on your list You have assessed yourself. You have taken many self-assessment tests. You have talked to family and friends about the work they do. You probably have a long list of different careers in front of you. Look again at your list. Think about the careers on the list you know a lot about. Then, circle the ones you know very little about. Use the Internet to get more information about them. Find websites that give descriptions of the work. Look at the training or qualifications that are needed to do the work. Learn about the opportunities available for people who do this career. Learn how people may move up the ladder. Look at government websites that give information about career trends. Find out how much money people can make in each career. Learn what companies usually hire people. Find out what parts of the country have the best opportunities to be hired. Think about if you would be willing to move to those cities. Find out the demand for this kind of work – will it be in high demand when you finish school? Is it a fast-growing industry? Or, is demand slowing? Will it be difficult to find work in the future? After you have done the research, you can cross out the careers that do not interest you. Choose your Career 4. Visit the Career Service office Each school or university will have a Career Service office. They will have a team of people that can give you career advice. Their everyday work is to help students with choosing their careers. They have a lot of knowledge about different careers. They have a lot of knowledge about career trends. They have a lot of knowledge about the qualifications you may need. They also know which companies are looking to hire students. So, go and visit them today! Talk to them about your ideas for your future career. They will listen to you. They will be able to give you some great advice. Even if you do not know what you want to do, they will able to help you. They will ask you many questions to assess you. They can then suggest what careers may be a good match for you. In my own experience, the Career Service office helped me a lot at my university. They listened to my ideas about what I wanted to do. They suggested a training course that I should take to get the correct qualifications. And, they even called the teacher training school to arrange an interview for me. Thanks to the Career Service office, I was able to find my career. I got a place on the course and trained to be a teacher. Choose your Career 5. Go on field trips The Career Service office at a school or university may also arrange field trips for students. A field trip is a day visit to a company. It is an opportunity to get some direct experience. You can see what a typical working day is really like at the place of work. It is also an opportunity to learn about the company. You can listen to talks from people who work there. You can ask them questions. By doing so, you will learn a lot. A field trip offers you the opportunity to meet and talk to the people who work in the industry. You can get the real stories. You can learn about the possible opportunities that are available at the company. You can also understand more about the skills people need to do the work. The field trip might be a day at a bank. It might be a visit to a police station. You might spend the day at a company that makes food. Or, it may be a day at a car factory. Or, you could spend a day at a farm. There are many different field trips that you can go on. They can help you to decide whether you’d like to work in that industry or not. Choose your Career 6. Do a part-time job A part-time job is just a job. It isn’t really a career. However, doing a part-time job while at school or university may help you with choosing your career. By doing a part-time job, you can get real work experience. You can also start to develop important skills. For example, you may learn how to work well in a team. You may learn how to communicate well with colleagues and customers. You may learn how to manage time well. And, you may learn how to solve problems. By doing this, you can assess yourself. You can assess what you are good at doing. And, you may learn about what you are bad at doing, too! A part-time job may also give you opportunities to see what kind of work you enjoy. For example, you may do a part-time job at a coffee shop. You really enjoy it. You like working in a team. And, you really enjoy talking to the customers. Then, you may decide to look for a career in the service industry after you graduate from school or university. It is also possible that your part-time job becomes your full-time career. There are examples of students who did a part-time job. They were then hired by the same company after they finished school or university. Choose your Career 7. Do volunteer work When you do volunteer work, you work for free. You work to help people. You might help people who have no homes. You might help old people who need care. You might help people who have experienced a natural disaster. You might help the city you live in to be a cleaner and better place. Helping people is important. And, doing volunteer work can make you feel good about yourself. But, how can it help you when choosing your career? Similar to doing a part-time job, volunteer work can help you try different kinds of work. By doing this, you can learn a lot of new skills. It can give you real work experience. You can meet many new people. You can talk to them about their careers. You can get great advice. And, it can help you to assess yourself, too. For example, you can learn if you like working outside or inside. You can learn if you like working with others or by yourself. You can learn if you like doing different work each day or doing the same job. Once you have a good idea about a career that matches you, doing volunteer work in that industry can be important. Imagine you want to become a vet assistant. If you have done some volunteer work looking after sick animals, it may help you to get hired. 8. Do an internship Another way to try working in different industries is to do an internship. When doing an internship, you may work for a company for a short time. On a good internship, you won’t just be asked to get the coffee for your colleagues and boss. You will be asked to do similar work to a regular worker. That way you can get real work experience. You can learn from your colleagues. You can learn about the industry. And, you may get paid for your work. Like a part-time job or volunteer work, an internship will also give you the opportunity to see if you enjoy working in the industry. As a student, you may wish to do an internship during your vacation time. For example, a summer internship may last between two weeks to two months. You may decide you want to do a longer internship. You may take some time off from your school to do so. Or, you may decide to do an internship once you have graduated. You can find out more about internships by talking to people at the Career Service office. You may talk to older students at your school. You can also search online for internships in your city or country. You may even decide to do an internship in a different country! Choose your Career 9. Make a plan You’ve assessed yourself. You’ve talked to family and friends. You’ve researched careers. You’ve visited the Career Service. You’ve learned about possible field trips, part-time jobs, volunteer work, and internships. Now, it’s time to make a plan. Think about your future goals. What do you see yourself doing next year? What do you want to be doing in 5 years? Where do you want to be in 10 years? For example, you may be interested in sports. You enjoy skiing. You know you are not good enough to be a professional skier. But, you really enjoy going to ski resorts. You enjoy talking to the people you meet there. So, you make a plan: •Study hospitality and hotel management at university. Get qualifications (Next 4 years) •Study languages. Get qualifications (Next 4 years) •Do internships at ski resorts during vacations. Get work experience (Next 4 years) • Join university ski club (Next year). Become manager of the club (In 3 years). Get management experience. • Graduate university. Work at a ski resort as an assistant manager (In 5 years) • Become manager (In 8 years) • Work in a different country (In 10 years) Your plan will probably change. Most plans do. However, by making a plan, you’ve started to assess your situation. You’ve started to think about the actions you need to take for your career. 10. Your career may find you You may still not know what you want to do. You may be stressed. But, don’t worry! Sometimes, your career will find you. Of course, it is a great idea to make a career plan. And, it is a great idea to get some work experience. However, life is always changing. And, there are many wonderful opportunities that can happen to you. You may start a job. Then, one day, you meet somebody who works in a different industry. They are interested in you. They want to hire you. You take this opportunity to do something different. Suddenly, you find yourself with a new career. You find your life going in a new, exciting direction. Maybe, you start a job. Then, one day, there is no longer a demand for this kind of work. The company closes. You lose your job. However, you now have lots of useful skills and experience. Then, you get some good career advice. You decide to do something new. Or, you read about an opportunity in the newspaper. You decide to try this career. Maybe, you even decide to start your own company. In life, we never know what will happen. And sometimes, career opportunities will come our way. There may be changes. But, that’s exciting. Just enjoy the adventure. Summary Now, you have read the book, stop and think again.

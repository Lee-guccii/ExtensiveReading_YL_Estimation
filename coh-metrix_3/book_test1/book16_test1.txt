Foreword In September 1939, Germany attacked Poland, starting the Second World War. Soon France and Britain and many other European countries were involved as well. Germany attacked France in May 1940 and, by the start of the following year, was in control of most of Europe. In defeated France, some French men and women joined together, usually in small secret groups, to fight back. They were called the Resistance. They came from all economic levels and political backgrounds of French society and they did all they could to make life difficult for the Germans. They were important in the fight against the enemy, but also important for the French people, who wanted to feel that there was still hope. The Resistance also helped send information about the Germans to their enemies. This information made a big difference, especially when the Americans, the British, and others attacked France in June 1944 and began to push the Germans back into Germany. This was the start of the end of Germany’s war in Western Europe. The Second World War lasted until 1945 and involved most of the world’s nations. It was the worst war in human history, leaving 70 million people dead. Doctor or soldier? “Doctor! Help me! Please!” Doctor Patrice Mardieu was preparing for another long day of work when the young man ran suddenly through the door. His face was covered in sweat and full of fear. “Please!” repeated the man. “Hide me!” He looked no more than eighteen years old. As he spoke, he looked quickly around the clinic. “What is it?” asked Mardieu. “What’s wrong?” Then the young man noticed the back door. Without another word, he hurried toward it. At that moment, there was a loud shout from outside, a shout in German. Instantly, Mardieu knew what the problem was. But before he could do anything, and before the young man could escape, a German soldier charged into the room. The soldier’s mouth was bleeding as though he’d been hit, and he looked very angry. And he was holding a gun. “Stop!” the soldier called in French. Mardieu realized the young man would never get out the back door in time. And the young man realized it, too; Mardieu watched him turn and, without hesitating, throw himself at the soldier. It was a brave but desperate move. The soldier was far bigger than he and looked far stronger. But the German was surprised and didn’t have time to raise his gun. Instead, he was forced to drop it. As it fell to the floor, the two men began to fight. It was a messy, animal fight; they swung their arms wildly and pulled at each other’s hair. But it was clear to Mardieu from the start who would win. Without thinking what he was doing, Mardieu stepped forward and picked up the gun. “Stop it!” he shouted, pointing the gun at the soldier. The German froze, but didn’t raise his hands. “What’s happening here?” demanded Mardieu. “Give me my gun, Doctor,” replied the German. “Or you’ll be going with him.” “Going where?” The German looked toward the young man who, unsure, was slowly moving again toward the back door. “I’m taking him to the Chateau. Henckel’s orders.” “Why? What’s he done?” “Henckel said we have to bring him two dozen villagers. Because of yesterday’s attack.” Mardieu knew what the soldier was talking about. Just the day before, the French Resistance had attacked the area’s German commander, a man called Albrecht Henckel. They were trying to kill him, but the attack failed. The Resistance fighters had escaped. And now the local French people were paying the price instead. “Please,” begged the young man. “Don’t let them take me. You know what happens in the Chateau.” Mardieu had heard the stories. The Chateau Loyette was a large castle that stood on the hill looking down on the town below. It belonged to the Loyette family, an ancient and respected family who had protected and guided the town of Tierroy for hundreds of years. But when the Germans attacked France four years ago, they sent the owner of the house, the old Duc de Loyette, away, and stole everything he had. The Chateau was now the main command center for the German Army. It was also the home of Commander Henckel. Henckel controlled the whole area, all the way north to the sea, where it led across to England. And Henckel was a man who seemed to enjoy making the French population suffer. “If they take me to the Chateau, I’ll never come out again,” said the young Frenchman. “Please, help me.” Thinking fast, and still keeping the gun on the soldier, Mardieu turned toward the clinic’s front window. In the square outside, a few German soldiers were pushing several villagers into a truck. Mardieu made his decision. “Go!” he said, nodding toward the back door. “Run!” “Thank you,” said the young Frenchman, already moving toward the door. Seconds later, he was gone. The German soldier looked at Mardieu with something like pity. “That was foolish, Doctor,” he said. “Perhaps,” replied Mardieu, still holding the gun. “But you’ll have no reason to complain. You’ll still have someone for the truck. We’ll wait a few minutes to let the boy get away. Then you can take me instead.” “A hero, are you?” laughed the German. “And what about your patients, when you’re locked in the Chateau?” Although he didn’t show it, the thought worried Mardieu. After all, he had returned to Tierroy from Paris to help the people of his hometown. Yet what could be a greater help than to save this boy’s life now? At that moment, Mardieu heard a cry from the back of the building. Looking out through the open door, he saw the young man. He hadn’t escaped. Two German soldiers had caught him. They were holding him between them and walking with him back to the clinic. When the defeated Frenchman saw Mardieu still holding the gun, he came to life again. “Shoot, Doctor!” he called, starting to struggle once more. “Shoot!” Mardieu stepped through the door and raised the gun. He pointed it first at one soldier and then at the other. There was nowhere for them to run. “Don’t move!” he shouted at the soldiers. “Let him go!” “There are three of us, Doctor,” said the German behind him. “Do you have time to shoot us all before we get to you?” Mardieu stepped quickly into a position from where he could see all three soldiers. “Do you want me to try?” he asked. His voice was hard and serious. “Do it!” shouted the young Frenchman. “Shoot them!” Mardieu only had to fire the gun, and the boy would be free. He held it tightly, and aimed it carefully at one of the soldiers. But instead of shooting, he hesitated. He couldn’t do it. He was a doctor. It was his duty to help people and to care for those who were ill or hurt. That had always been made clear to him, since his first days at medical school: his duty was to all humans—a duty not to hurt or kill. It was even more important than his duty to his country. The soldiers holding the boy sensed his hesitation. One of them began to move slowly forward, holding out his hand. “Give me the gun, Doctor,” he said. The young Frenchman screamed. “No! Please, Doctor. Shoot!” His face was red with fear and confusion. But still Mardieu hesitated. He couldn’t shoot anyone, not even a German. It would be against everything he believed in. Slowly, as the young Frenchman’s face turned from confusion to anger, Mardieu began to lower the gun. At that moment, he felt a strong blow to the back of his head. The first soldier had moved quietly forward and hit him hard. Mardieu fell to the ground, dropping the gun. He could only watch as the German picked it up. “Get up!” shouted the soldier. “You’re both coming with us.” As Mardieu slowly rose to his feet, the young Frenchman was led past to the waiting truck. And more painful than the German’s blow to his head was the look of disgust on the young man’s face. Sudden death The old Frenchman needed help. That was obvious. He lay on the Chateau’s cold stone floor, coughing steadily. His daughter was on her knees beside him, holding his head and trying to hide her tears. Like everyone else, they had been waiting in scared silence for hours, waiting to discover what Henckel was planning. “Guard!” called Mardieu. He stepped up to the thick metal bars and shouted. The cellar, far beneath the Chateau and previously a store for food and wine, was now a dark prison. His voice rang off the walls. “Guard!” “Silence!” came the shouted reply. “At least give us some water!” called Mardieu, but there was no answer. And then there was the sudden sound of a door opening. A little more light fell into the cellar, and a German soldier appeared on the steps. Immediately, the guard stood to attention. “Mardieu!” the soldier called. “Which one of you is Doctor Mardieu?” “Here,” Mardieu replied. “I’m Doctor Mardieu.” The soldier signalled to the guard, who pulled some keys out of his pocket and stepped toward the nearest gate. “Come with me,” ordered the soldier. Mardieu immediately understood why he was being separated from the rest. After all, no one else had done anything wrong. But he had tried to help the young Frenchman escape. Now he was to be punished. In Tierroy, Henckel was the law. No one dared to disagree with him. And Henckel was a man with a taste for cruelty. So what sort of punishment was he about to face? On the other side of the cellar, the young man was turned toward the wall. He was still crying quietly, just as he had done in the truck all the way to the Chateau Loyette. As Mardieu was led through the gate, the young Frenchman turned and, when he saw Mardieu, the fear on his face turned once more to disgust. But it was more than that; it was a look of accusation. Although he was upset to see the boy’s thoughts so clearly and scared about what would happen next, Mardieu was determined to show a brave face. Standing tall, he followed the German guard. Soon, he was climbing ancient stairs toward the next floor. Up there it was brighter and far more comfortable, like a home rather than a prison. Two soldiers with guns were following him. Together, the four men walked across the Chateau’s main hall. Even then, scared as he was, Mardieu recognized the beauty of the building. He had only visited the Chateau once before, as a child with his father. Before he died, Mardieu’s father had been the town doctor. Mardieu used to go with him on his visits. And once they had visited the Duc de Loyette, here in the Chateau. The soldiers led Mardieu out the back of the building and into a yard. It was dark; the morning sunshine was hidden by the high, solid walls. “Stand there!” ordered the guard, pointing to the corner. The two soldiers stepped back, their guns ready. Suddenly it was clear. And it made horrible sense. Mardieu’s hands began to shake as he realized. There would be no understanding from Henckel or his men. He was to be shot, here and now, in the yard of the Chateau Loyette. A man like Henckel would never allow anyone to point a gun at one of his soldiers and live. The guard began to walk away. He was not even staying to see him die. Mardieu looked around, desperate, like a scared animal. But the high walls blocked any escape and the door behind him was now closed. Besides, it only led back to more German soldiers. The only way out of the yard was past the two soldiers, who stood watching him, their hands on their guns. The fear rose inside him. But Mardieu was determined not to give in to it. He wouldn’t die like an animal. He would show his murderers that he could face death bravely. Forcing his shaking hands behind his back, Mardieu stood straight, his head turned to the blue sky above. He fought to control his breath and could hear his heart beating harder and faster than ever before. Then, despite his fear, as he waited for the sound of his own end, a thought came to him of someone else who was perhaps looking at the same blue sky: the only woman he had ever truly loved, perhaps still living here, somewhere in Tierroy, somewhere in the town below . . . Suddenly, a shout cut through Mardieu’s thoughts. “This is it,” he thought. His whole body was tense. Still staring at the sky, he tried to hold on to the comfort of his last thought. But then another shout made him look down again toward the soldiers. They hadn’t yet even raised their guns. “Here!” It was the guard who was shouting. He had reappeared and was calling for Mardieu to follow him. As his confusion slowly became relief, Mardieu took a slow step forward. And then another. Breathing heavily and on shaking legs, he was soon past the soldiers. They then followed him around a corner, and through another door. Mardieu was inside a living room, one that he recognized even after so many years. It was the same room where his father had looked after the old Duc. But then Mardieu was led through another door, into a smaller room. And then, after the guard had knocked on yet another door, Mardieu was waved into a large private study. Although it was late spring, an enormous fire was throwing heat into the room. The walls were covered in expensive books. Beautiful old oil paintings hung on the wall. From the window, Mardieu could see the whole town of Tierroy at the bottom of the hill. In front of the window was a large wooden desk. And sitting behind the desk was Commander Henckel himself. Henckel looked up and nodded at the guards. They instantly left the room. Mardieu was alone with the most hated and most feared man in Tierroy. Henckel’s demand “Good morning, Doctor,” began Henckel, speaking in perfect French. He didn’t even look at Mardieu; he simply continued to sign papers on the desk. His thin black hair was flat against his head, and his face was pointed and sharp. Mardieu said nothing. He knew the stories about Henckel. He knew the German never showed any pity. Henckel’s actions were sometimes so extreme that even his own men were said to question his orders. But, of course, they only ever did so in whispers, never to his face. “You know why you are here,” continued Henckel, still not looking up. It was a statement, not a question, but still Mardieu answered, his mouth dry. “I know.” “Then you will understand that you must be punished for your actions.” “I know that you will want to punish me for what I’ve done. That at least makes sense. But I don’t understand why you’re punishing so many others. The people in the cellar have done nothing wrong. They aren’t the ones who attacked you yesterday.” At last, Henckel put down his pen and looked up, annoyed. “You forget, Doctor,” he answered, “that although Germany has beaten France, there are still some who believe we remain at war. And so, until those people agree to be ruled by us, that war will continue. Those people in the cellar are therefore the enemy. And until I catch the people directly responsible for yesterday’s attack, they will remain there.” “Some of them are old. They won’t survive without medical attention!” “Then Dubois will be responsible for their deaths.” Like everyone in Tierroy, Mardieu knew of Dubois. Dubois was the leader of the local Resistance and was admired by the French as much as Henckel was feared. Nothing was known for sure about Dubois. Some said he was an old soldier who learned to fight in the First World War. Others claimed he was a local farmer whose family had been killed by the Germans. And some thought that Dubois wasn’t his real name at all, and that he was really a British agent sent over to help organize the Resistance. Whatever the truth about Dubois, he had continued to fight Henckel and his men when the rest of Tierroy had given up. His group of Resistance fighters continued to upset Henckel’s plans with growing regularity, and the German commander had clearly had enough. “When Dubois is caught,” continued Henckel, “I’ll let everyone go. Not before.” “That’s . . .” began Mardieu, but Henckel interrupted with a shout. “Silence! You are not here to discuss my decisions!” In his anger, the German rose to his feet. At the movement, he began to cough badly and placed one hand on the big desk for support. Surprised, Mardieu stood waiting for Henckel to recover. Henckel picked up a towel from behind the desk and wiped his face. When he began to talk again, it was quietly, as though trying not to cough once more. “I am prepared,” he said, “to forget about your actions this morning, on one condition.” He stopped, and took a long look at Mardieu. “You have recently returned from Paris, is that correct?” “It is.” “And your work there?” “At the Val-de-Grâce Hospital.” “A hospital for wounded soldiers.” “That’s right.” “I understand you worked with patients with breathing problems?” “Who told you that?” “Answer the question!” “I worked with Doctor Troude for three years. He’s perhaps the most respected expert in the country for problems of that kind.” Henckel nodded, and stepped out from behind the desk. “So that should now make you one of the most respected experts in the country. Good.” He began to walk slowly around the room. It was as though he was making a decision. Then he stopped before the fire, and continued, “Before I was posted here, I fought in Russia. And I was wounded. I was shot in the side. I was lucky. It was serious at the time, but I recovered. Now I am generally in good health, although occasionally I have problems with my breathing. And unfortunately, yesterday’s attack has made the situation worse.” Henckel turned to face Mardieu. “You will treat me, Doctor,” said the German. “You will give me the best possible service. My own doctors will watch and learn from you. If at any time I suspect that you are not doing everything you can for me, I may find myself remembering your actions this morning. In which case, you will be shot immediately.” A visit from the past Mardieu returned Henckel’s stare as he considered his position. It didn’t take him long to decide. “Your threats are unnecessary, Commander Henckel. I’m a doctor. That means I have made a professional promise, to help anyone who needs my help. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they have done.” “Even we Germans who have attacked your country?” “Even you,” answered Mardieu, quietly. “So that is why you failed to shoot my men this morning? Because of your professional promise?” The German now had a slight smile on his face, as though he thought the idea of Mardieu’s promise was in some way amusing. “It is my duty to do all I can to avoid hurting anyone.” “I understand,” nodded Henckel. “You are a medical man, not a soldier.” “A medical man cannot be a soldier, if fighting means hurting someone.” “And what about your people? Don’t you worry what they will say?” Mardieu thought again of the young man in the cellar and of the look of disgust on his face. What would he think now if he knew that Mardieu had agreed to help Tierroy’s greatest enemy? “I’ve said that I will treat you, Commander Henckel. And I will do everything I can to help you recover from your injury. But that doesn’t mean I have to like it.” At that, Henckel laughed. “That is an attitude I better understand,” he said. “So, how shall we proceed?” “I will need to perform some tests on you. I will be available at my clinic as soon as you let me go.” “No. You will do the tests here, in the Chateau.” “But all my equipment is at the clinic.” “Then you must bring your equipment here.” A hard smile appeared on the German’s face. “And since you care so much, you may even bring medicine to treat the prisoners as well.” “Fine,” agreed Mardieu. He knew what Henckel was doing: the German wanted to be sure that Mardieu would return to the Chateau and not simply run away. “But I will still need to see you at the hospital.” “Impossible. I cannot risk it after yesterday’s attack.” “But you will need a special machine.” “Then I will send some men to collect it.” “But that machine is needed by other patients at the hospital!” “I am your number one patient now, Doctor. Remember that. Otherwise I might remember that, doctor or not, you pointed a gun at my men.” Less than thirty minutes later, a German truck let Mardieu out in the center of Tierroy. Despite the soldiers everywhere, the town seemed so normal. It was hard to believe that, barely one hour before, Mardieu had stood in the yard of the Chateau Loyette waiting to die. He felt very tired, with no energy for the rest of the day. Usually the clinic was noisy and crowded, and Mardieu worked hard from first light until long after it was dark. The war had resulted in a shortage of medicine and several of the other local clinics had been forced to close, so people came from all around to visit Mardieu. But someone must have seen the Germans taking him away. Now the door of the clinic was open, just as the soldiers had left it, but the waiting room was empty. Obviously, no one expected him to come back. Mardieu stood by the tap in the back room and drank some water. Then he washed the sweat from his face. When he closed his eyes, he could see in his mind the young Frenchman. He could see again the young man’s disgust and fear. And he felt once again angry with himself. He was proud of his skills as a doctor and of his ability to help people, and he was aware of his medical duty. But he was also a proud Frenchman and, more than anything else, wanted his country to be free of the Germans. Perhaps he should have done more to help the young man escape. But what? Suddenly, there was a knock at the front door of the clinic. Mardieu straightened and checked his appearance in a nearby mirror. Part of being a good doctor, his father used to say, is appearing confident and calm, even if you don’t feel it. Or perhaps especially when you don’t feel it. He stepped out into the waiting room at the front. A woman was standing by the door. It was bright outside and so her face was in shadow. For a moment, he thought she was just another patient wanting his help. “Yes?” he asked. “What’s wrong?” But then the woman spoke his name and he recognized her immediately, even after seven years. “Patrice?” she said. Mardieu said nothing. He had imagined this moment for so long. But he still didn’t know what to say. He didn’t know if he should be angry or sad or perhaps even thankful. And so he said nothing. “Patrice?” she said again. At last he nodded. “Hello, Laure,” he said. The woman turned and said something he couldn’t hear. It was then that Mardieu realized that she wasn’t alone. Someone else was standing just outside the door. But before he could see who it was, she stepped into the clinic, closing the door behind her. “It’s good to see you again,” she said. “You too.” There was a short silence, and then Laure spoke again. “Why have you come back?” she asked. “They have enough doctors in Paris,” he said. “And if the British and Americans do attack, Tierroy will be in the middle of the fight. This town will need all the help it can get.” Laure moved closer. Despite the warm weather, she was wearing an old hat. As she pulled it off, Mardieu could see that her soft red hair was already changing. She was no older than he, yet her hair was already darker and even turning gray at the sides. But her skin was still as smooth as ever. She was older, of course, but there was no doubt she was the same woman he had always loved. The thought made Mardieu’s insides turn over and over like the hat in her hands. “I was sorry not to see you when you came back, when your father died,” she said. “He was a wonderful man.” Mardieu nodded. “He was. And he told me about your husband in one of his letters. And about your son. I’m so sorry.” At his words, Laure looked away. It was as though she couldn’t bear to talk about her loss, and Mardieu hurried to talk about something else. “You look well, Laure, despite everything.” Her eyes were shining with tears, but Laure managed to smile. It was the same smile he remembered so well. Despite the war, despite the husband and the child she had lost, despite the years between them, Laure still had that smile, and Mardieu still had its memory. “So how can I help you?” he asked. “You’re surely not ill?” Laure shook her head and looked again at the closed door behind her. “I need you to do something for me,” she said. “Of course. What?” “I need you to kill Commander Henckel.” Lives in the balance “I don’t understand,” said Mardieu, shaking his head. “I know that you met him this morning. And I know that he wants you to treat him. I’m asking you to kill him instead.” Laure’s words were so surprising that they didn’t seem real. “Laure, I don’t know how you know all of that. But I’m a doctor. It’s my job to stop people dying, not to kill them.” “I know.” “Yet you’re asking me to go against everything I believe.” “No, I’m asking you to kill one man, one evil man, to save many, many more good men, women, and children.” “How do you know I was with Henckel this morning? I’ve only just got back.” “Patrice, I work for Dubois. When he learned that you had been taken to the Chateau, he knew it was an opportunity.” “An opportunity? What do you mean?” “How do you think Henckel learned of your special skill as a doctor? I told Dubois, and Dubois made sure that the Germans heard about it. We’ve known about Henckel’s breathing problems for a long time. And we learned last night that our attack made it worse. It was obvious that he would ask for your help.” “And was it so obvious that I would agree?” Suddenly, Mardieu felt angry. But he wasn’t angry with Dubois or Laure for the way they had put him in this position and perhaps risked his safety even further; he was angry with himself. A part of him was, of course, embarrassed to be helping Henckel. And he didn’t like to think of himself as so predictable. He especially didn’t like to think that Laure could guess so easily that he would agree to help the German. He didn’t like to think that she might judge him badly for his decision. “Dubois is well informed,” he said. “He must have someone working for him inside the Chateau.” “I don’t know about that. All I know is what he tells me and that you have a chance, Patrice, to make a big difference. I know that you’re a good man. And believe me, it’s not easy for me to ask you. But if you kill Henckel, you will be doing more good for this town and our country than you could do in this clinic for a hundred years.” Laure had stepped closer to him. She was looking up at Mardieu’s face with a hard seriousness that he had never seen in her before. He stepped back, and shook his head. “I’m sorry, Laure. I understand what you’re saying, but I can’t do what you ask. In fact, I’m surprised that you came at all. You know that doctors aren’t allowed to engage in acts of war. When I began working as a doctor, I made a promise, and it’s a promise I’ve always kept. I won’t hurt anyone and I certainly won’t kill.” “Not even to save lives? Or in exchange for your own?” “What do you mean?” asked Mardieu. “The only reason you’re not in the Chateau’s prison right now is because Dubois let Henckel learn about your work. Thanks to Dubois, you’re free, you’re in Tierroy, and you’re going back to the work that you love. That means you won’t be with the other prisoners when they’re taken to the woods and shot.” “What? What are you talking about?” asked Mardieu. “Henckel plans to shoot the prisoners.” “No! He told me he’s only keeping them until he catches Dubois.” “Does it matter what he told you? I’m telling you the truth, Patrice. We’ve seen the soldiers preparing the site in the middle of the wood. They’re digging two dozen wooden posts into the ground in a line. There’s only one reason they would do that.” “But why? Why would he just kill them?” “He’s made it clear,” said Laure. “There are notices going up all over town. Henckel wants Dubois to turn himself in. We’ve got until sunset tomorrow. Unless our leader gives himself to the Germans within twenty-four hours, every one of those men and women in the Chateau’s prison will be shot.” The killer doctor? Slowly, Mardieu moved across to a chair and sat down. He was shocked that someone could make such a threat. He found it hard to believe that anyone could kill all those people, people who had done nothing wrong. But he was sure that, if anyone could, that person would be Henckel. Laure stepped closer. “When are you seeing Henckel next?” “Tomorrow afternoon,” answered Mardieu. He spoke without thinking. His mind was still on the horror of Henckel’s threat. “He’s sending some men to the hospital to collect my equipment at noon, and then I have to follow them to the Chateau to perform his tests.” “So that’s our chance. Somehow, you will have to kill Henckel then. Perhaps tell him that he needs an operation, and then make sure that he doesn’t survive. Or tell him you’ve made him a special medicine, then give him poison instead.” The idea woke Mardieu from his thoughts. “No!” he said, determined. It seemed so wrong. It was bad enough for him as a doctor to even think about killing someone. But it was especially terrible to kill someone while pretending to help. “Patrice,” said Laure softly, “this is our only chance to save those people.” “I don’t understand. Why do you think that Henckel’s death will stop his men following his orders? The prisoners might still be killed, whether Henckel is alive or not.” “You’re wrong,” answered Laure with confidence. “Soon, perhaps within a few days, the Americans and the British will land in France. Then it will only be a matter of time before the Germans lose this war. They know that; they have too many enemies now. And when this war is over, no one wants to be remembered as a killer. For Henckel, it is too late. After everything he has done, he has nothing to lose. But the others know that if they shoot people in such a way, they will find no forgiveness.” “You don’t know that.” “I know the man who will be in command when Henckel is dead: Major Luboschik. He’s a soldier, with a soldier’s sense of honor. And he would never allow murder.” “Not even after his boss has been murdered?” “Henckel is a soldier, and we’re at war; his death would not be murder. Besides, we’re talking about more than just the prisoners. Henckel’s death will hit the Germans hard. He’s sitting in Chateau Loyette now and he’s planning how to fight off any attack. Without him, the Americans and the British have a greater chance of success. And as a result, fewer people will die. By cutting the fighting short, you’ll even be saving German lives.” Mardieu said nothing. “I know what I’m asking, Patrice,” said Laure, moving to sit beside him. “Henckel isn’t stupid. He’ll probably tell you to test any medicine on yourself first. And of course, even if he doesn’t, or if he dies during an operation, it will be obvious what has happened. They will know it was you who killed him. The Resistance will do all we can to help you escape. But the Germans might catch you. If that happens, you would be giving your one life to save many. Believe me, I would take your place if I could. But right now you’re the only one who can do this.” Still Mardieu was silent. “And there’s something else,” continued Laure. “Look outside, Patrice.” Puzzled, Mardieu rose from the chair and stepped toward the window. There, outside the clinic door, was the man Laure had been talking to earlier. He was enormous and standing as though guarding the building. He was dressed in a suit that seemed several sizes too small. It didn’t hide the fhe was a fighter; he stood with his huge hands ready for action as, above his thick beard, his eyes searched the surrounding streets. It was as though he expected the Germans to arrive at any second. “That’s Nicolas Coulon,” said Laure. “He sees things very simply: you’re either with us or against us. He believes that anyone who agrees to help the enemy should be treated like the enemy. And he’s not the only one who thinks like that. You know that, don’t you?” Mardieu thought of the young man he had allowed to be caught and nodded unhappily. “Coulon thinks you should be killed for even thinking about helping Henckel. But I told Dubois that you would help us. I told them that you love your country and will do what has to be done.” At last, Mardieu turned back from the window and looked down at the woman he had once loved more than anyone in the world. “I do love my country,” he told her. “But I’m sorry, Laure. You were wrong. I don’t like this situation any more than you and I certainly don’t like having to help Henckel. But I’m a doctor, and he is now my patient. His health is therefore my primary concern. That is my duty.” “But . . .” “Please,” interrupted Mardieu. “Let me try to explain. I know my decision will be difficult to understand. And believe me, you’re the last person in Tierroy that I want to disappoint. But this is about something bigger than me, bigger even than France. This is about my duty to my profession and my profession’s duty to the laws of humanity. I can’t get involved.” Laure rose angrily to her feet. “You want me to return to Dubois to tell him that?! That you care more for your own peace of mind than the lives of hundreds, perhaps thousands? You know what might happen.” “I’m not afraid to die, Laure. I realized that this morning, when they stood me against a wall and I waited to be shot. Please try to understand. This isn’t about my fears; it’s about my principles. I’m a doctor! And doctors help people. We don’t kill them!” Laure was silent for a moment and then, slowly, she nodded. She reached out and, for the first time in many years, she touched Mardieu, taking his hand in hers. “I understand, Patrice,” she said quietly. “And I hope that this war always remains distant enough to allow you to keep those principles. I really do. Because there are some of us for whom such high principles are no longer possible.” Then, without even a good-bye, Laure turned around and walked out the door. And as soft as her words had been, they seemed to bite at Mardieu’s spirit. It was painful to watch her leave and painful to recognize the full weight of her sadness. And in her clear disappointment, he saw again the disappointment of the young man lying at that very moment in the Chateau’s cellar, a young man who, whether he knew it or not, was waiting to die. For the first time in his professional life, Mardieu felt torn in two, and uncomfortable with his professional decision. “Laure!” he called, at last. “Wait!” Laure’s head reappeared around the door. She watched him in silence, her eyes heavy with sadness. “I’ve got an idea,” he said. Mardieu’s plan At noon the next day, Mardieu watched from the fourth floor of the hospital as a German truck parked by the back door. While one soldier stayed to guard the vehicle, four more disappeared into the building below. “They’ve arrived,” Mardieu told Coulon and the other two Resistance men beside him. The men checked their guns. “Here,” said Coulon. He held out a gun. “Take it.” But Mardieu only shook his head. “I’m a doctor.” Coulon made a low, angry sound. “It won’t hurt you to hold it,” he answered. “The Germans don’t need to know that you’re too scared to shoot.” “No! Just do as we agreed!” replied Mardieu. “No one needs to get hurt. We just need their uniforms and their truck.” He took a last, nervous look around the room. Coulon and another man were now hiding in the next room. The third Resistance fighter was dressed like Mardieu, as a doctor, in a long white coat. He was pretending to prepare the large machine needed by Henckel at the Chateau. Mardieu heard the soldiers before he saw them. He heard the sound of their boots coming closer. He took a deep breath as they entered the room. “Doctor Mardieu?” asked the one in front, an officer. He was tall and thin and obviously in charge. The other three soldiers stood silently behind him. Mardieu nodded. He could see that the Germans all had their guns. “We’re here for Commander Henckel’s equipment. Is this it?” Mardieu felt as if his life was balanced on an edge. There was a risk that everything he believed in was about to fall. Unable to speak, he only nodded again. “And it’s ready to go?” asked the officer. From the corner of his eye, Mardieu could see the Resistance man dressed as a doctor begin to move his hand toward the gun in his pocket. “Yes,” he answered, and he hoped the German wouldn’t recognize the strange sound of his voice. “Good,” said the officer. He turned to the others. “See that this machine is taken safely to the truck. If it is damaged in any way, you will answer to Commander Henckel.” The three soldiers approached the machine. They took their guns from their shoulders and placed them against the wall, ready to lift it. “You, of course, Doctor, will come with us . . .” began the officer. But he was interrupted by a sudden noise behind him as the Resistance men ran through the door. “Don’t move,” shouted Coulon, pointing his gun at the soldiers. At the same moment, the other Frenchman raised his gun. The Germans were completely surprised, and they were surrounded. Mardieu moved carefully to block the main door as, with no choice, the Germans slowly raised their hands. “Take their guns!” Coulon ordered. The man dressed as a doctor picked up all their guns and threw them into the room next door. Mardieu didn’t take one. “Now,” said Coulon, “give us your uniforms.” “You will all be shot for this!” shouted the German officer angrily. “Silence!” Coulon shouted back, waving his gun. “Do as I say!” The German officer stood in the middle of his men and watched as they began to remove their clothes. Then, slowly, he began to loosen his belt. Mardieu watched with relief. His plan was working! Then, suddenly, the officer gave one of his own men a strong push and jumped toward the door. The soldier fell into Mardieu, blocking his way. In seconds, the officer was past him and running out of the room. The other Frenchmen couldn’t shoot because Mardieu was in the way. He was the only one who could stop the officer escaping. “Shoot him!” shouted Coulon. But Mardieu didn’t have a gun, and without a gun there was nothing he could do. He watched, helpless, as the German officer disappeared around a corner. Immediately, Coulon turned back to the room. “Don’t move!” he said to the other Germans. Then he walked quickly to the window, opened it, and shot his gun into the air. He shot twice, an obvious signal. Mardieu stepped over to the window, to see who the signal was for. He could see the Germans’ truck but no one else, not even the guard. “What does that mean?” he asked. “It means that you’ve destroyed everything,” answered Coulon. He was shouting still, but this time at Mardieu, and with anger and disgust. “Look!” The Resistance fighter pointed out the window. Down below, the German officer had appeared by the hospital door. The Frenchmen could only watch as he climbed quickly into the truck and drove away at top speed toward the Chateau Loyette. For a moment, it seemed that Coulon was unable to speak. He seemed close to losing control. As he watched the truck disappear, he lowered his face onto the window with something like sadness. Mardieu couldn’t understand. He knew that the plan had failed. But Coulon’s reaction still seemed strange. “I’m sorry,” he said. But Coulon ignored him. Without even looking at him, the big Frenchman turned suddenly back to his men. “Tie them up!” he ordered, pointing to the three German soldiers. “Quickly! The prisoners will all be dead by sunset. If we’re going to rescue them, we need to go to the woods now!” “You’re continuing with the plan?” asked Mardieu, amazed. Still the big Frenchman ignored him. “Hurry,” he said to his men. “You can’t!” cried Mardieu. “Without a German truck, there will be no surprise. And the Germans will be far stronger! You’ll all be killed.” “We have plenty of men,” answered Coulon. He was already moving toward the door. “They’re ready to surround the prisoners’ trucks. And they’re ready to die if they have to.” “But the idea was to use the uniforms to surprise the Germans, to make them give up without a fight! So no one has to die!” “This is a war!” shouted Coulon, over his shoulder. “That’s what happens!” “But you can’t succeed!” shouted Mardieu. “There will be too many guards!” “You let the officer escape,” answered Coulon. “So if we don’t succeed, then you will be responsible.” He pulled Mardieu toward the door. “And you will pay the price.” A worthy death? The ground beneath Mardieu was hard and dry, but he didn’t notice his discomfort. As he pushed himself lower into the ground, he looked at the Frenchmen hiding in the wood all around him. And he tried to understand how his plan had gone so wrong. “Coulon!” he called. “That German officer will be back at the Chateau by now. Every German in Tierroy will know that you’re planning something. You’ll never get close to the prisoners!” In his hiding place nearby, the big Frenchman said nothing. His eyes were on the road ahead. It was just forty meters away beyond a thick line of trees. “My plan relied on total surprise, so no one would get hurt,” continued Mardieu. “But they’ll be ready for you now. You and your men will die for nothing! Is that what you brought me here to see?” At that, Coulon turned suddenly. “No!” He whispered, but his anger was still clear. “If we make sure that the Germans pay, then no one will die for nothing!” With that, Coulon turned back to the road. Like everyone else, he was waiting for the prisoners and their guards to appear. And he was ready to attack. Mardieu felt miserable. He could already feel the blood on his hands and the weight of his guilt. It had all gone wrong because he had let the German officer escape. Because he had refused to touch a gun. Because of his principle to avoid hurting anyone, whatever the result. There were at least twenty Resistance fighters hiding all around the road, and more on the other side. And they all had guns. But it would never be enough. There would be at least two trucks of prisoners, each one with German guards. And there would certainly be at least one more truck full of soldiers. The Resistance had no chance. “Get ready!” Coulon whispered to the other men. “Wait for the signal!” “Wait!” called Mardieu. “Let me speak to Dubois. This isn’t what we agreed.” “Keep quiet!” answered Coulon. “Your weakness has risked everything. You have no right to speak.” “Where is Dubois? This is . . .” “Coulon!” interrupted one of the nearby Frenchmen. “Listen!” In the sudden silence, they could hear the sound of approaching engines. The Germans were coming. There was no time left to discuss the situation, no time even to argue. Seconds later, the first German truck appeared around a corner. It was carrying prisoners and progressing slowly along the forest path. Even Mardieu could see that the Resistance had chosen a good place to attack. But that wouldn’t be enough. A second truck appeared, also with prisoners. He could see the old man and his daughter among them, and the young man, all of them looking scared. Then came a third truck, this one full of German guards, all with guns. Mardieu looked around him at all the Frenchmen hiding, waiting, ready to attack. And he felt sure that, in just a few minutes, they would all be dead. But there was nothing he could do. He would try to help anyone who was hurt, of course, both French and German. And no doubt the Germans would then arrest him, and probably shoot him with the other prisoners. But Mardieu didn’t care. He felt powerless and broken inside. The trucks drew closer. Soon Coulon would give his signal to attack. Mardieu watched the big Frenchman. He looked worried, nervous. He kept looking back, away from the trucks, toward the town of Tierroy. “It doesn’t make any sense,” thought Mardieu to himself. “If he doesn’t give the signal to his men soon, the trucks will pass. It will be too late.” And then, suddenly, there was a noise like nothing Mardieu had ever heard. It shook the whole forest. The air itself seemed to jump into light. He turned toward Tierroy. Something had exploded. Up on the hill above the town, the Chateau Loyette had disappeared behind an enormous cloud of dust. “What happened?” asked Mardieu. Coulon closed his eyes. His face seemed sad but, at the same time, satisfied. “Dubois has done it,” he whispered. “What?” asked Mardieu. “Dubois has done what?” “Look!” said Coulon, pointing toward the hill. Mardieu looked again. The cloud of dust was starting to move and to reveal what remained of the Chateau. It had been completely destroyed. The beautiful old building was now just a large amount of broken stone. Fire was rising from all around, fanned by the wind, and thick smoke was gathering into heavy clouds. There was no doubt in Mardieu’s mind: no one inside the Chateau would have survived. The decision “What happened?” Mardieu asked again. At last, Coulon turned to look at Mardieu. “Your plan gave Dubois an idea for something more, something bigger. We just needed your help.” “Help? With what?” “We needed the German uniforms and the truck.” “Yes, to surprise the guards.” “No. While we were upstairs in the hospital, Dubois was loading the truck with explosives.” “Explosives?” “Dubois’s plan was simple. With the German uniforms a few of us would pretend to be the soldiers delivering the medical equipment to Henckel. When we had driven into the Chateau, we’d set the explosives and leave.” Mardieu looked back at the Chateau. “So Henckel’s dead?” “Exactly. And with the Chateau destroyed, the Americans will find it a lot easier to attack. The Germans will be completely disorganized. Look!” On the forest path, the noise had stopped the trucks. Some soldiers had stepped out to talk urgently. One of them pointed toward the remains of the Chateau. “So when the German officer escaped and drove the truck back to the Chateau,” asked Mardieu, “it was full of explosives?” Coulon nodded. “Full enough; Henckel has been collecting explosives in the Chateau for months in preparation for the Americans’ attack.” “But how did Dubois escape from within the Chateau without a German uniform?” Coulon shook his head. “There was no chance,” he answered sadly. “If Dubois had tried, they would have found our explosives. The only way to be sure the plan worked was to hide in the back of the truck and stay with the explosives to the end.” “You mean Dubois is dead?” “Yes. But not for nothing. She gave her life for a greater good.” “Wait!” interrupted Mardieu. “You said ‘she.’ Do you mean Dubois was a woman?” Beyond the trees, the German guards were still standing beside their trucks. They were discussing what to do. Still carefully watching them, Coulon almost smiled. “She was the strongest of us all. After the death of her husband and son, she promised to continue the fight. She took his name and his place in the Resistance.” At last, Mardieu realized the truth. “Laure! Laure was Dubois!” “And thanks to her, we’re going to win.” “But now she’s dead.” Mardieu dropped his head toward the ground. “It’s my fault,” he said quietly. “I refused to kill Henckel myself, and I allowed the German officer to escape. I forced Laure to give her own life.” Still watching the German guards, Coulon looked quickly across to where Mardieu lay, his face hidden in the grass. “She died as she would have wanted,” said the big Frenchman. “And the war will be over all the sooner as a result.” Mardieu could understand what Coulon was saying. He was saying that Laure’s life was a fair price to pay for saving hundreds, probably thousands, of others. But still the pain felt like a tearing inside. It caught his breath and left him shaking. And in his sadness and his guilt, he realized something else. “It’s just as she predicted yesterday in the clinic,” he thought to himself. Mardieu’s war was now immediate and personal. And at last he knew what had to be done. War offered no choice. As the Resistance fighters watched, the truck carrying all the German soldiers turned back toward the Chateau. They left behind the two trucks of prisoners, with no more than five or six guards. “Ready?” whispered Coulon to his men. “Wait!” said Mardieu. “Stay back, Doctor,” replied Coulon. “It’s time to fight.” “I know,” answered Mardieu. He thought again of the young Frenchman somewhere in the truck before him, just waiting to die. “And now I’m ready.” Coulon looked at him, and nodded. And then, slowly, he held out a gun. And without hesitation, Mardieu took it and prepared to fight.

Introduction We all have things we need to do for our jobs or for school. We may need to write reports. We may need to prepare presentations. We may need to research things. We may need time to plan, practice, and prepare things. However, it is very easy for us to procrastinate. It is easy for us to delay or avoid doing our work. It is easy for us to waste time. We may wake early in the morning. And then, we decide to stay longer in bed. We go back to sleep. We may start playing games on our smartphones. And then, we decide to play for a longer time. We may switch on the TV to watch one TV program. And then, we decide to watch TV all night. We may start our work. And then, five minutes later, we decide to go for a walk or decide to start cleaning the house. Being productive means that we produce a lot. We get things done. We don’t procrastinate. Being productive is about the best use of our time. We use our time well to do the things we need to do. Now, stop and think for a moment about your life. Are you productive? Or, do you often procrastinate? Do you want to be more productive? Let’s look at ten ways that you can do this: 1. Create your workspace Think about where you do most of your work. Do you have your own workspace? Is your workspace a good place for working? Is it comfortable? Is it quiet? Is it a good place for concentrating on your work? To be productive, it is a good idea to have a separate space for working and a separate space for relaxing. Your workspace could be a desk in your room. It could be a table in a study room. It could even be a table in a library or coffee shop. When you go to your workspace and sit down, you then know that it is time to work. Your workspace should be a comfortable place with a good chair. It should be a place where you can concentrate. It should be a place where other people will not talk to you in the middle of your work. Your workspace should be clean and tidy. This will help you concentrate. It will also be easy to find the things you need. Your workspace should also be quiet. However, some people like to work while listening to music. If so, choose music with no words. This will also help you concentrate better. Create or find a workspace that is the best for you and your productivity. 2. Set goals and times Think about the work you need to do. To be more productive, set yourself goals every day. Start each day with a list. Make a list of the things you will work on. Make a list of the things you plan to finish that day. If you have a big task you need to do, separate it into smaller tasks. These tasks can then be done over a few days or weeks. Remember not to have too many things on your daily list. You want to be able to achieve your goals with the time you have available. When working on your daily goals, set a timer. Choose a time you will work for. For example, this could be 25 minutes. Start the timer. Concentrate on your work for 25 minutes. Then, take a 5-minute break. Set the timer for another 25 minutes. Start the timer again. Concentrate on your work for another 25 minutes. Take another 5-minute break. Keep doing this. After 2 hours of working, start to take longer breaks after each 25-minute period of concentration. By doing this, you should get lots of work done each day. Your productivity should increase. 3. Have routines Think about how you spend your time every day. Having a good routine can help you be more productive. When we have a good routine, we set the times that we will work and the times we will relax. We stick to the routine, so it becomes natural to us. It becomes a natural part of our everyday actions. If we have a good routine, we don’t need to think about starting work every day. Often, when we think about starting the tasks we need to do, we procrastinate. Then, nothing gets done. Therefore, having a good routine means that we don’t procrastinate. We just get started on our tasks. A routine also makes it easier for us to concentrate on our tasks. To be productive, it is also important to take regular breaks as part of our daily routine. For a short break, close your eyes for a few minutes. For a longer break, get up. Move your body. Go for a short walk outside. Get some fresh air. For your lunch or dinner break, make sure you move away from your workspace. Then, you will feel like you are really on a break. You will return more refreshed. You will be ready to start work again. And, you will be more productive. 4. Do the most difficult things first Often, we like to start our day with the easy tasks first. After all, these tasks are easy to do. And, we feel good when the tasks are finished. However, this means that the more difficult tasks are still waiting for us. Later in our day, the work will get more difficult. We may then decide to delay or avoid doing these more difficult tasks. We may procrastinate and not finish what we need to do. To be more productive, therefore, it is a good idea to start with the most difficult tasks first. This way, we feel good when the difficult tasks are finished. And, our tasks get easier and easier for us as we work through the day. Also, when we first start work, we should feel the freshest. We have the most energy. Therefore, this is the best time to do the most difficult tasks. As the day goes on, we may lose our energy. We may feel more and more tired. It is harder for us to concentrate. Then, this is the best time for us to do the easy tasks we need to do. In this way, by doing the more difficult tasks first, our overall productivity should increase. 5. Don’t multitask Think about how you work. Do you do many tasks at the same time? Do you start new tasks before finishing old tasks? Do you keep switching between many different tasks? If your answer is yes, you are multitasking. People who study productivity think that multitasking is bad for us. Multitasking may slow us down. When multitasking, we work on many tasks at the same time. And, we often switch between these tasks. However, we can waste a lot of time. We use time to switch our thinking from one task to the other. We use time to stop thinking about the old task. We use time to start concentrating on the new task. The more often we switch between tasks, the more time we waste. Over a number of days or weeks, this can be a lot of wasted time. When multitasking, it is also very easy for us to lose our concentration. We can easily get distracted from our work. When we switch between different tasks, we stop concentrating. At that point, we may decide to check our phone messages. We may switch on the TV. We may look out of the window. We waste time. Therefore, to be more productive, we should concentrate on one task only. When we finish it, we can then concentrate on our next task. 6. Avoid distractions Think again about how you work. When you start a task, can you concentrate? Can you continue doing your work? Or do you stop and start? Do you easily get distracted? To be productive, we need to avoid distractions while working. Of course, switching off our smartphones is the best idea. But, when we are doing tasks on the computer, it is easy to check our emails or SNSs. This can be a problem, however. Once we stop our work to check something, it is often difficult to start again. We may end up wasting lots of time. We may end up spending time checking messages, reading posts on SNSs, liking posts, and commenting on posts. Therefore, avoid checking emails and SNSs when doing tasks. Another big distraction is the TV. We may like to watch TV while working. But often, we get interested in the TV show. We end up watching the show and not doing our work. Therefore, it is best to switch off the TV when doing tasks. Finally, people can also distrfrom our work. Put a “Do not Disturb” sign on your door while working. This will stop people trying to talk to you. Another idea is to find a place to work where people will not disturb you. This might be a library, a coffee shop, or even a park. 7. Use your commute productively Think about how long it takes you to get to work or school. What do you usually do during your commute? Do you chat with friends on your smartphone? Do you play games? Do you sleep? Do you look out of the window? We can waste lots of time commuting to work or school every day. To be more productive, it is a good idea to use the time to get things done. For example, we can use our commute to set our daily goals. We can think about the tasks we need to do. We can plan things. We can think of new ideas. As we do this, we can write notes in a notebook. Or, we can type notes into our smartphones. Also, we can use our commute to read. We can check the Internet for useful information. We can read books. We can study something important. We can read something that will help us with the tasks we need to do. Finally, we can use the time on the train or bus to talk to others online. For example, we can use SNSs to ask questions to friends, teachers, or the people we work with. We can discuss the tasks we need to do with them. We can share ideas with them. And, we can get help and advice from them. 8. Find ways to motivate yourself Think about your motivation to do things? Are you always motivated to work hard? Are you always motivated to do the tasks you need to do? Or, do you often procrastinate and do nothing? You may not always be very motivated. So, it can be difficult to be productive. You may need other people to motivate you. Post your tasks on SNSs. Share them with your friends. Share what you have done. Share what you still need to do. For example, “I’ve written 800 words of my report. 1,200 words to go!” Your friends may comment on your post, “You can do it!” or “Keep going!” You will feel more motivated to finish the task. Also, share your daily goals on SNSs. For example, you may post, “Today, I’m going to study in the library for 4 hours.” As you have told all of your online friends, you will feel pressure to do it. You will feel you have to do it. If you don’t achieve the goal, you may feel bad. And, you may look bad to your friends. Finally, of course, deadlines are the best way to be motivated to work. As your deadlines get nearer, you should feel very motivated to finish each task. As you work to each deadline, your overall productivity should increase. 9. Be healthy Think about your health. Do you get enough sleep each night? Do you sleep well? Do you eat the right kind of food? Do you have lots of energy? Or, do you always feel tired? Do you feel like you have no energy? Sleep is very important. People who study sleep think that we need 7 to 9 hours sleep every night. However, we may sleep less than this. This is a problem. If we don’t get enough sleep, we can’t be productive the next day. We won’t be able to concentrate on our work. We will make many mistakes when working. And, it will be easier for us to become distracted. The food we eat is also important for productivity. People who study food think that the right kind of food can help us to concentrate better. For example, eating bananas and strawberries can give us lots of energy to keep working. Having some dark chocolate can help us to keep concentrating on our work. Drinking lots of water can also help our concentration and make us more productive. However, eating unhealthy food, like potato chips, may make us feel tired and less productive. 10. Know yourself And finally, it is important to know yourself. Know when the best time for you is to work. For example, you may be a morning person. You may get up early and can get lots of work done then. You may be a night person. You work best in the evenings and late at night. You may get lots of work done before you go to sleep. To be productive, plan to do your work at the best time for you. Also, know what works for you. Know how you work best. Know how you do the things you do. Know what can get you started on the tasks you need to do. Know what can keep you going when doing tasks. Know more about what helps you to achieve your goals. This will help you to keep being productive. However, sometimes, you may not want to do anything. You may waste time and find it difficult to get started. If you do start a task, you may find it difficult to keep going. You may have a very unproductive day. When this happens, don’t feel bad about it. Just think, “Today, I needed to relax. My tasks will still be there tomorrow. Tomorrow, I will get them done. Tomorrow is another day.” Summary Now, you have read the book, stop and think again. Do you think these ten ways can help you to be more productive? Do you have, or can you create a good workspace that helps your productivity? Can you set daily goals and times for your work? Can you create a good routine for working? Is it a good idea for you to do your most difficult tasks first? Can you do something productive while you commute to work or school? Do you know how to motivate yourself to do the tasks you need to do? Can you be healthier? Is it a good idea for you to sleep more? Can you eat healthier food? And, most importantly, do you know yourself? Do you know how and when you do your best work? After all, in life, each of us has a choice. We can procrastinate, or we can get things done. Productive people don’t even think about it. They just get things done.

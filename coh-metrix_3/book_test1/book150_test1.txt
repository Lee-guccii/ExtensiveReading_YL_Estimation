Introduction What does ‘environmentally friendly’ mean? Why is this something we should try to be? Being environmentally friendly means living in a way that does not hurt our planet. It means being friendly to the Earth. Environmentally friendly people make choices about what they do. They do things that keep the air and water clean. They think about how their choices imppeople. Look around our planet. We can see that there is lots of trash. We can see that the roads are full of cars and trucks. We know our water may not be clean for drinking. We know that pollution and trash are changing the weather. We buy things every day. We often buy more things than we need. This means we throw away many things. Making the things we buy causes air and water pollution. And, we create more trash. Also, people in other countries may only get a small amount of money to make the things we want. Being environmentally friendly means making better choices. These choices make life better for everyone. Now, stop and think for a moment about your life? Do you think about the choices you make every day? Are the choices you make friendly to the environment? Do you want to be more environmentally friendly? Let’s look at 10 ways you can do this: 1. Use your car less Most of us have cars these days. We like to drive them a lot. We can go where we want to. And, we can go when we want to. But, cars cause a lot of air pollution. When you are in your car, look around. How many cars do you see with only one person in them? In some countries, people carpool. This means people go to the same place together in one car. For example, workers may go to work in the same car. If four people share one car, that is three cars that are not being used. This helps to reduce air pollution. It also reduces the number of cars on the road. This makes travel by road faster and safer. For short trips, we should think about walking. Walking is good for the environment. And, it is good for our health. Everyone should walk 10,000 steps every day. You can use a special machine to count your steps. Can you walk to school or work? If it is a little far to walk, how about cycling? Bicycles are also good for the environment. They do not cause air pollution. 2. Save water People need water. Plants, birds, and animals need water, too. We can live for many days without food. We can only live a few days without water. So, water is a very important resource. Too many people use too much water. And, we need energy to make water clean. It takes energy to get water into our homes. So, we should try to save water. Or, in the future, we might not have enough! What will happen in the future if we do not have water? In fact, many people in the world do not have enough water now. They think very carefully about how they use water every day. And, we should, too. Think about the many ways you use water every day. You drink it. You wash your clothes and your dishes with it. You use it when you flush the toilet. You use it when you take a bath or a shower. Do you know we use about 40 liters of water for a ten-minute shower? So, how can you save water? Try taking a shower for a shorter time. Put the bath water you use into your washing machine. Use the short flush on your toilet. Don’t leave water running. Wash your dishes in a bowl of water. Saving water is very important for all lives. It can also save you money! 3. Reduce plastic trash Plastic is everywhere. We use a lot of plastic in our daily lives. Plastic is not good for the planet. It does not breakdown. This means it stays plastic for a very long time. We can recycle plastic. We can make new things from it. But, we use too much of it. We cannot recycle it all. Plastic trash is often thrown into oceans, rivers, and lakes. This pollutes them. It is also dangerous for birds, fish, and other wildlife. We are busy. And, plastic makes life easier for us. We may think it is difficult to reduce plastic. However, using less plastic is a way to be more need a lot of the plastic you use. For example, do you really need a plastic straw with your drink? Also, when you go shopping, take a bag with you. Say no to plastic bags in the supermarket. Don’t buy lunches in plastic boxes. Make and take your own lunch. Don’t buy drinks in plastic bottles. Carry a cup or drink bottle with you. This will help reduce plastic trash. It will help the environment. It will save you money, too! 4. Save electricity Isn’t electricity wonderful? We use it for heat and light. We use it for our computers, TVs, and rice cookers. We use it for our smartphones. We often look for places to charge our smartphones every day. We use electricity all day without thinking about it. So, why should we save electricity? Electricity is mostly made from gas, coal, and oil. Using these resources makes pollution. But, some countries use energy from the sun and wind to make electricity. This is better for the Earth. Heaters and air conditioners use a lot of electricity. In winter and summer, they work very hard. To be more environmentally friendly, turn the temperature of your heater down a little in winter. In summer, turn the temperature of your air conditioner up a little. Do you have the TV on all day? Turn it off when you are not watching it. Turn off your computer. Turn off machines you are not using. At home, change your lights to environmentally friendly ones. They use less energy and they last longer. Electricity costs money. Saving electricity helps the environment. It will save you money, too. 5. Use less paper Paper is another thing we use every day. We read books. We make notes. We buy newspapers. But, our air and water is polluted. Some of this pollution comes from making paper. Factories that make paper use a lot of water and chemicals. These chemicals go into the air. They also go into rivers and lakes. After reading this, think about each time you use paper. Always write on both sides of a piece of paper. If you are photocopying something, print on both sides. Do you have a smartphone or a tablet? Use it to make notes at school or work. Some people like to use a pen and paper. It helps them to think. If you like to write things down, use recycled paper. Use the back of pieces of paper you have in your home. The back of a large wall calendar makes very good notepaper. Instead of buying paper books, use your smartphone or iPad to read eBooks. Like this one! Use newspapers in the kitchen instead of kitchen paper. There are many ways we can use less paper. 6. Clean friendly How many cleaning products do you have? Many people have a cleaning product for the bathroom. They have one for the kitchen. And, they have one for the toilet. Do we need to have different cleaning products for each room? These products have strong chemicals in them. These chemicals are not good for our environment. These chemicals get into rivers and lakes. They change the way plants grow. The chemicals are dangerous for fish, birds, and other wildlife. We should buy cleaning products that do not use these chemicals. Healthfood stores sell cleaning products that are environmentally friendly. Buy a cleaning product that can be used everywhere in your house. Look on the back of bottles and boxes. A picture of a smiling Earth means the product is environmentally friendly. Change your shampoo and body soap, too. Buy products without chemicals. These products are better for the environment. They are better for your body, too. Also, you can make your own cleaning products at home. Homemade cleaning products do not use chemicals. They are more friendly for the environment. They are also healthier for you. Look in the library for a book about how to do this. Look on the Internet. Cleaning products are fun and easy to make. 7. Buy locally grown food We all enjoy eating food from other countries. For example, we like to eat bananas and avocados all year round. But, how does this food get here? It comes by airplane, by trucks, and by ships. This uses a lot of gasoline. Also, the food needs to be kept cold. This uses energy. Also, who grows this food? Are these people being paid fairly for their work? Food that is grown locally is more environmentally friendly. It can be brought to stores more easily and quickly. This uses less gasoline. The food is also fresher. It does not need as much energy to stay fresh. Many supermarkets sell locally grown food. We can see who grew it. We can see where the people grew it. Buying locally grown food also supports local people. Look around your neighborhood. Is there a farmers’ market in your area? Farmers’ markets are special stores. They sell fruit and vegetables. They also often sell honey, jam, bread, and juice. Locally grown food is healthier for you. It is better for the environment. And, it supports the local people, too. 8. Repair things What do you do when something breaks? Do you throw it away? Do you go out and buy a new one? These days we often buy new products when something breaks. We throw away many broken things. These things become trash. And, where we put this trash on Earth is a problem. In the past, people knew how to repair things. But, we quickly replace broken things. So, we have forgotten how to do this. Being able to repair things is useful. It is something we can all learn. Go to the library. Look at books about how to repair things. Look on YouTube for easy to follow lessons. With a few simple tools you can repair many things. Have a look around some stores. You can find useful tools for doing repairs. Ask someone at the store to help you. Also, repair your clothes. For example, if you have a hole in your jeans, repair it. Repairing things helps to reduce trash. It is better for the environment. You learn new skills. And, it will save you money, too. 9. Make gifts We all like to give gifts. We all like to receive gifts. In fact, giving gifts is big business. Companies tell us we need to give gifts. For example, we should buy something on birthdays, on Father’s Day, on Mother’s Day, and on Valentine’s Day. On these days, do you feel you should buy something? Do you buy a gift for someone special? Using things you have in your house to make gifts is environmentally friendly. The gifts we buy in stores take a lot of energy to make. Factories pollute the air. We use gasoline to get products to shops. Making a gift at home uses much less energy. It does not make pollution. It also reduces the things in your house you do not need. Instead of buying a gift, why not make one? Food is always a nice gift. Make some cakes or cookies. Make some juice or salad oil. Put the gift in a jar, bottle, or tin. Decorate it with paint or colored pens. Use paper with nice pictures. Old calendars are good. Make a book cover or a photograph album. Get ideas from the Internet. Look at websites like ‘Pinterest.’ Get ideas for gifts by looking around the shops. Think about how you can make the things you see. You may find you have a talent for making gifts. 10. Make better choices In our lives, we spend a lot of time and money shopping. Many of the things we buy are not good for the environment. Many of the things we buy are made in other countries. The people who make them are sometimes not paid well. Some companies care about this. These companies make products that are environmentally friendly. They pay workers fairly. So, it is important for us to think about the things we buy. Think about where the products we buy come from. Think about who makes them. Think about how much they get paid for making them. Learning about companies helps us to make better choices. So, before you buy something, look at the company that makes it. Is it an environmentally friendly company? Do their products help or hurt the environment? Some companies do not think about the environment. They do not think about the people who make their products. Use the Internet to find out which companies are environmentally friendly. Is this company trying to make the world better for everyone? Try to buy products from environmentally friendly companies. But first, ask yourself, do I need to buy this anyway? If the answer is “no,” don’t buy it. Summary Now you have read the book. Do you think these 10 ways can help you to be environmentally friendly?

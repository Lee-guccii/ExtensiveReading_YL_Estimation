Introduction In nature, many kinds of animals work together. For example, ants show each other where to find food. They help to bring the food home. Some animals hunt together. They kill faster animals by attacking from many directions. When these animals cooperate, their job becomes easier. People also cooperate all the time. Working in a team is an important skill that everyone should learn. Everyone can learn a lot when they work as part of a team. People are all different. We all have different things we are good at. We all have different skills we can offer a team. This means we can help each other by being part of a big project. However, working in a team can be very difficult. People are different. And, we all think and This can cause problems when we try to work together. We all want people to listen to our ideas. So, sometimes, we can keep speaking without listening to others. Sometimes our pride makes us feel better than others. But, in a good team we should all feel the same. We should feel that we are all important. Now, stop and think about the times you have worked in a team. Did you feel happy to work together with others? Was it easy, or was it difficult? Why? A good team works well together. They cooperate, and each team member feels happy. Here are ten ways to help you work better in a team: 1. Know your strengths Everyone is different. We all have strengths – something we are good at doing. For example, some people have good computer skills. Some people can do math quickly. Some people are good at speaking to a large group of people. The first step to becoming a good member of a team is to understand yourself. You should know your strengths. And, you should know which skills you are not so good at. You should tell your team about your strengths. This way, the team will know what kind of jobs you can do easily. Imagine that your team is working on a project. They need to decide which member should do which job. If a job matches your strengths, you should offer to work on that job. You should also learn about the other members in the team. You should learn their strengths. If you ever have a problem, you will know which member to ask for help. Each member of your team can give you some good advice. They can help you solve problems quickly. 2. Ask for feedback Maybe, you are a new member of a team. Maybe, you have been a member of your team for a long time. You can be a new member or an old member. But, everyone should always listen to feedback. Listening to feedback is the best way to continue getting better at your job. People in your team, your team leader, your customers, or your teachers can give you good advice. You should always listen and try to improve. Feedback can prevent blind spots. Feedback helps you see and understand a problem. Sometimes, you may not even know there is a problem. If we learn about the problem, we can start to solve it. We can find an answer or improve it. Sometimes, we may have a bad habit, but we do not know it is bad. And sometimes, our pride stops us from listening to good advice. But, if you listen to feedback, it will always help you to improve yourself. Also, if people know that you listen to feedback, they will trust you more. And, they will always tell you if there is a problem. This is because they know that you will listen. This kind of rapport is very important in any team. You should build rapport, because it will help you solve problems in the future. 3. Cooperate Good team members must be able to cooperate. This means they have to be able to talk to each other. They have to be able to share ideas. And, they shouldn’t argue. In a team, you have to talk to everyone. You need to understand goals, problems, and plans. Tell the members in your team if you have problems or need advice. Help your team members if they ask for your help or advice. Listen when members of your team speak. And, think carefully about their ideas. If you have an idea, make sure you explain it clearly. Include important information, but don’t waste time by including too much information. Many times, you might disagree with another team member. Speak clearly but kindly. Explain why you agree or disagree with a plan. Listen to the team member’s opinion. By sharing information, you can decide which plan is the best. Often, you can make a new plan that everyone can agree on. Cooperating also means working hard together. Every member should do their best. Team members should share the work in a balanced way. No team member should work too much or too little. 4. Build trust A good team needs trust. When people work together, trust is the key to great teamwork. Trust is also the key to members feeling good about the team. A good rapport will help you build trust. And, trust will help you improve your rapport! Also, listening to feedback will help you to build trust with the members of your team. Another way to build trust is to share the credit for good work. Maybe, you work together with a team member and do a job well. Then, make sure you tell everyone that the other member helped you. Everyone should know that they worked hard, too. If someone helped you to think of a good idea, you should share the credit for that good idea together. This helps people to trust you. They will want to work together with you. They will want to share ideas. Sometimes, when you are working with a team member, you both make a mistake. However, you shouldn’t put the blame on the other team member. You should say when you make a mistake. If you are cooperating with someone, you should share the blame. You should work together to try to solve the problem. Blaming other people may feel safer when there is a big problem. However, it is much more important to keep the trust of the people in your team. 5. Brainstorm Many teams brainstorm to create new ideas. Creating new ideas and plans helps your team to improve. It is a great way to solve problems. Every team should learn how to brainstorm. First, you should have a big area to write on. You can use a large piece of paper. Then, you should decide what you will talk about. This can be a problem that your team wants to solve. Or, it can be a way for your team to get new ideas. When you start brainstorming, all of the team members can give their ideas. Write each idea on the paper. If you want, you can use lines and boxes to help put the ideas together. There is one important thing to remember when brainstorming. There are no bad ideas. This means that everyone should say the ideas they have. They should share their ideas even if they are not sure they are good ideas. There should be enough time for everyone to give their ideas. The paper should be full of ideas. Sometimes one team member will say an idea. Then, that can help another member think of a new idea. This is why brainstorming is such a great way to get many ideas. When you finish brainstorming, look at the ideas together. Then, your team can decide which ideas are the best. 6. Use technology Technology helps everyone to do many kinds of jobs. Many problems that people had in the past can now be easily solved using technology. Use technology in your team to help everyone work together and to work well. If you are working in a team with members who are far away from each other, then you should use technology to help. Use email to send messages to team members whenever you want to share information. Sometimes, you may want to talk directly with a team member. Then, you should use a program that sends video over the Internet. You can talk to your teammate face-to-face using modern technology. Talking directly can help you build better rapport. It can help you share ideas. And, it can help you solve problems quickly. When there are many members in a team, it is often difficult to stay organized. You can use technology to help everyone stay organized. You can share a calendar with team members online. You can also discuss ideas and plans by sending an email to your team. You can also send photographs by email to many team members in only a few seconds! 7. Be a leader A good leader is important for any team. The leader decides on a clear goal for the team. The leader helps decide which team members should work on which jobs. Every team member might have different ideas or plans. So, the leader should listen to the different ideas and decide on the best plan. The leader should have good rapport with every team member. Then, it is easy for team members to talk to the leader. They will also trust the leader’s decisions. You will often have a chance to become a leader. If you understand the most about the job, and you understand the members of your team well, you should be the leader. If you have a lot of experience, many people want you to be the leader. If you think you would be a good leader, say something at the beginning of a new project. You can always offer to be the leader of your team. However, being a leader means having a lot of responsibility. Your decisions may be good or bad, but they are your decisions. The credit, or the blame, is yours. You are responsible for any big problems. You are responsible for solutions. To help you, always use your team members’ strengths and cooperation. 8. Don’t be a leader Many people want to become the leader because of their pride. Or, maybe they think being the leader is an easy job. It may be difficult for some people to let someone else be the leader. However, too many leaders make working in a team very difficult. Team members may not know who to listen to. Different leaders may make different decisions at the same time. And, this can cause big problems. So, if your team already has a leader, you should follow what they ask you to do. Don’t try to change the plan. If you disagree with the leader, don’t argue with them. You should wait and talk to the leader face-to-face. Always tell your leader important information. But, support the leader’s decisions, too. You need to do this even if you have a different idea. If the leader gives you a job to do, you should do your best to help the team and your leader by doing that job well. If you are not the leader, you still need to think for yourself. If you have a problem, you should first try to solve it yourself. Or, ask for another team member’s help. If the problem is too big or important, you should tell your leader. That way, the team can brainstorm solutions to the problem together. 9. Think long-term Working in a team on a long-term job means that many things will change over time. Sometimes you will discover that you would be better doing a different job in the team. Maybe, you have different strengths that you want to try to use in your job. People grow and change every day. Also, your interests may change. Don’t be afraid to try new jobs. Don’t be afraid to ask the leader for a change. You can try doing a different job in your team. Then, you can see if that job feels good for you. Often, these kinds of changes can be important to the team. Making small changes and trying new things can help the team do well in the long-term. For example, your strength might be working with computers. Imagine you work for a big company. Every day you work in front of a computer. But, you think you would be better doing a different job. Your long-term goal is to talk to people more often. Then, you could ask to change your job. You could become a trainer. You could teach other workers face-to-face about how to use the computers. This would help you to become happier. And, it would help your company, too. 10. Respect each other There is one way to build a good team that works the best of all. It is the easiest to remember. It can also be very easy to forget. It is a simple idea: Respect each other. If you respect your team members and leader, they will do the same for you. Remember that everyone is different. Everyone has different strengths. Sometimes, something that is easy for you to do will be very difficult for other team members. Don’t forget that each member in your team has different strengths. If they have problems, give them time to work more slowly. Or, give them some help. Then, they will help you when the next job is something that they are good at doing. If someone makes a mistake, help them do better next time. But, be careful about the way you help them. Make sure that your actions show that you respect the person. If you are the leader, don’t let your pride stop you from respecting your team. Respect your team members when you tell them what to do. Give them credit when they do something good. If you are not the leader, make sure you respect the leader and always do a good job. Respecting each other is the first step toward building rapport and trust. It is the most important thing to think about when you are working in a team. Summary Now you have read the book, stop and think again.

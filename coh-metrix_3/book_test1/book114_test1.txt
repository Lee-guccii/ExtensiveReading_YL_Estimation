Introduction Many people in the world think about their safety every day. Some people live in a country that is at war. Some people live in a place where there is a lot of crime. Some people live in a place that has many natural disasters. Sometimes, people can get hurt. Sometimes, people might steal our things. But, for most of us, we live in safe places. Our schools and workplaces are safe. Our cities help us to stay safe if there is a natural disaster. Our homes are safe. Public transport is safe. When we live safely, it can be easy to forget to take care of our things and ourselves. We can get used to being safe. We don’t always look around us. We don’t notice what is happening. We don’t always think about what we are doing. But, bad things do happen sometimes. Someone may try to steal our things. Bad things may happen to us when walking home at night. Also, when we travel to new places, we may not be careful there. Sometimes, we need to stay safe from people we know. We may also need to stay safe from ourselves when we feel very sad. Now, stop and think for a moment about your life. Do you do everything you can to make sure you stay safe? Do you think about staying safe when you are away from home? Do you think about your safety when you are going home at night? Do you know what to do if there is a natural disaster like an earthquake or a big typhoon? Are your relationships with other people safe? Do you keep yourself safe when you are feeling sad? Let’s look at 10 ways that you can stay safe: 1. Walking home When walking home late at night, you may need to keep yourself safe. To do this you need to use your intuition. Your intuition is when you have a feeling about something. It is when a feeling inside you tells you if something is good or not. You also need to use your eyes and ears. Look around you. Do you see anything strange? Do you see anyone that looks strange? Listen. Do you hear a car, or a person behind you? If you are looking at your smartphone, you cannot see things around you. If you use earphones, you cannot hear cars, bikes, or people behind you. Do you walk from the station to your home? Most of us walk the same streets every day. We know the roads well. We know where to cross the street. We know where to turn. We often don’t think about what we are doing. To keep ourselves safe we must think about what we are doing. Wear light-colored clothes so that cars and bikes can see you in the dark. Look around you when walking. Listen to your intuition. If something feels strange quickly as possible. For example, walk back to the station where there are other people. Or, phone home and let your family or friends know where you are. 2. Going to work or school Do you go to work or school by bus or train? In the morning, the buses and trains are very crowded. You may be in a hurry. You may be thinking about work or school. On buses and trains, people are pushed together. It is difficult to see what is happening around you. In a crowd, it can be easy for someone to take something out of your bag. So, use a bag that closes. Use a bag that you can put on your shoulder. Keep your things close to you. Keep your important things inside the closed bag. If you are using your smartphone, keep it in your hand at all times. Look around you. Do you see anyone or anything that looks a little strange? Do you see anyone acting strangely? Use your intuition again. Move as far away from that person as you can. In a crowd, it is easy for someone to touch you inappropriately. Look at what is happening around you. If you feel someone is getting a little too close to you, move away from them. Try to put your bag between yourself and them. If someone is touching you or being inappropriate, you can shout at them to stop. People who do this are not brave. But, you can be brave! You have a voice! Use it! 3. Traveling abroad In our own countries, we know what is safe. We know the customs of our own countries. But, when we travel abroad there are many things we do not know. We may not know which places are safe. We may not know how other people behave. We may not know what we can and cannot do. Before you travel abroad, find out as much as you can about where you will visit. Learn about the local customs. Find out which parts of the towns and cities are safe and which parts are not. In areas where many people like to visit, there are often thieves. Thieves know that visitors often carry a lot of money. Visitors carry expensive cameras. They may carry a passport. Keep your money close to you. Wear a money belt under your clothes, next to your body. Just carry a little money for each day. Buy a cheap wallet. Put just enough cash for a day in the wallet. If someone steals it, you will not lose too much. Keep your bag, camera, and phone with you at all times. Relax and enjoy your holiday but be aware of what is going on around you. 4. Going camping and hiking Camping and hiking are fun. They are great ways to get away from daily life. They are greats way to enjoy some natural beauty and fresh air. They are good for your health. But, remember it is important to stay safe when outdoors. Plan your trip well. Choose where you will go. Read about the place before you go. Check the weather. Does the weather look good? Is it safe for hiking and camping? Are there any wild animals? Can people easily get lost there? Nature is very powerful. A sunny day can quickly turn to bad weather. If the weather suddenly turns bad, your trip can go very, very wrong. Be prepared for bad weather. Take warm clothes that will keep you dry if it rains. Wear strong walking shoes or boots. Make sure you have water and dry food. You may get lost. You may fall and hurt yourself. These things are unlikely, but you must always prepare for them. Carry a flashlight. Carry a small first aid kit. Tell people your plans. Tell them exactly where you are going and when you will be back. Relax and enjoy your trip. But, be ready to something goes wrong. 5. Preparing for natural disasters Many of us live in countries where there are earthquakes or strong typhoons. These natural disasters can cause a lot of damage. We do not know when big earthquakes will happen. We do not know where we will be when they come. It is difficult to prepare. But, there are some things that we can do. Do not put heavy items on high shelves. Always keep a bag ready for an emergency. Put in a flashlight, batteries, water and a first aid kit. You may also need dry food and warm clothes. You may want to put in copies of your bank information, your driver’s license, and your passport. We know when typhoons are coming. The safest thing you can do is stay home! Public transport may stop during a typhoon, so don`t go out. If you have special storm windows close them. If not, put strong tape on the windows. Things outside may blow into your windows and break them. Bring plants and other small things in from outside. You may lose electricity or water so have plenty of water and dry food. Keep flashlights ready for use. Keep your phone charged. When the typhoon hits, stay away from the windows. 6. Being at home Home is our safe place. We can relax. We should not need to worry about things there. We all like to get home at the end of the day. We like to sit down, relax, and put the TV on. Most of the time we are safe in our own homes. But, do you do things to make sure your home is safe? For example, do your doors and windows close and lock? To be safe, make sure your doors and windows lock properly. Do you have a fire extinguisher? Do you know how to use it? Do you have a plan for how to get out of the house if there is a fire? If you live alone, don’t tell people who do not need to know. Don’t open the door to strangers. If someone comes to your door, see who it is first. Look out the window or through your peephole. Look for their identification or ID. Are they wearing a badge? If something is delivered, step outside your house. Do not invite the delivery person inside your home. Get to know your neighbors. Know what is going on in your neighborhood. Has anyone seen anything strange? Help your neighbors and they will help you, too. 7. Being at work/school For most of us, our workplace or school is a safe place. We go there every day. We do not worry about our safety. We do not worry about the safety of our things. However, sometimes, it is not safe. For example, someone may steal things from us. So, always keep your important things with you or in a locker. Do you know what to do if there is an emergency? Find out where the emergency exits are. Find out what to do if there is an emergency. Where do you go? When there is a safety practice at your school or workplace, take part. Then, remember what you have to do. Making inappropriate comments at work or school may be harassment. These can be comments about how somebody looks. Or, comments about what somebody believes in. Somebody sending you rude emails may be harassment. Somebody pushing you to date them may be harassment. If someone does this, ask him or her to stop it. If they do not, you can report them. Your school or workplace will have a system for reporting these problems. If anyone touches you inappropriately, report him or her immediately. No one should be harassed at work or school. 8. Socializing We all like to go out and enjoy ourselves. Socializing is important. We become closer to our friends by socializing together. We can also meet new people. Socializing is a good time to relax. It is a good time to forget about our problems and just have fun. But, we do have to be careful when we socialize. Try to go out with a good group of friends. Stay in the group. If you leave the group, stay in touch with each other by phone. Let other people know where you are. Let them know who you are with. Meeting new people is great. But, we should be careful. Do not tell strangers too much a bad feeling about someone, trust the feeling. Be polite and move away. Try not to drink too much alcohol. Most of us make bad decisions when we drink too much. Do not accept drinks from strangers. It is possible that a stranger may put something bad into your drink. So, never walk away from your drink. Have a plan for getting home and stick to it! Put your safety first! 9. Being safe in relationships Relationships with other people are important. Sometimes, people are friends. Sometimes, people may be more than friends. They may be dating. Most of the time these relationships are good. We feel good about ourselves with other people. These are healthy relationships. Sometimes, however, things do not go so well. Sometimes, when dating, our partner may not be good for us. When we are in an unhealthy relationship, we can’t always see it ourselves. Is your friend or partner unhappy if you spend time with someone else? Do they make you feel bad about yourself? Does your partner ask you to do things you don’t really want to do. When dating, we often share private information. We may share private, nude photographs. But, the relationship may end. Sadly, one person may then share your private information with other people. They may share the nude photographs with other people. Remember, it is not safe to send these kinds of photographs. Don’t let anyone push you into doing this. If you think you are in this kind of relationship, tell someone. Tell another friend or someone in your family. Stop dating the person. And, stay away from them. 10. Being safe from yourself Everyone has good days and bad days. But, sometimes we may be having more bad days than good. We may feel overwhelmed. We may have too much to do. We may have many problems. These feelings can make us feel sad. When we feel sad we have no energy. We stop doing the things we used to like doing. And, we find it difficult to do the things we need to do. This can make us feel worse. Some people like to hurt themselves when they feel very sad. Some people may ‘cut’ themselves or ‘self-harm.’ If you have these feelings, talk to someone. Tell a close friend or family member. A good friend will always listen to you. Do you have these feelings at a certain time of the year? Do you have them when you work too hard? Do you get enough sleep? Try to notice when you start to feel sad. Don’t take on too much work or study. Get lots of sleep. Try to go for walks. Exercise is very good to feel better. Talk to people who listen to you and support you. Talk to people who make you feel good about yourself. Talk to a counselor or doctor. Feeling good about yourself is one of the most important things you can do. You are worth it! Summary Now, you have read the book, stop and think again.

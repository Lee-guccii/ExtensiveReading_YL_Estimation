Introduction Most of us have to work. Students work to learn new things at school. They do their homework. They study to pass tests. Workers work to get money to pay for things. They work to help create things. They work to give a service to others. They work to belong to a team. They work to achieve goals. However, some of us work too much. We get so busy that we forget to spend time with our family and friends. We forget to do our hobbies. We forget to relax. We forget to have any free time and we forget how to enjoy it. A good work-life balance means that we divide our time carefully between work and leisure. We may work or study hard, but we also have time to do other things in our lives. We make time to go out with our family members. We make time to see our friends. We make time to travel, to play sport, or to enjoy nature. We make time to sit back and watch a movie. Now, stop and think for a moment about your life. Are you always busy? Do you work or study too hard? Do you want to achieve a better work-life balance? Let’s look at ten ways that you can do this: 1. Manage your time well We all have 24 hours in one day. But some people are able to do more with their time than others. Think about how you spend your day. Do you sit there thinking about what to do? Do you waste time? Or, do you get on with the things you have to do? You may have lots of homework to do. You may have many reports to write for work. You may have to clean your house, wash your clothes, and do the food shopping. So, you need to manage your time well. Make two lists of the things you need to do. Put the most important things on one list. Put the things that are not very important on a second list. Do the most important things first. When you finish each one, cross it off your list. Soon, your list of important things will be finished. Now, read the list of not very important things. Do you really need to do them? If yes, take a short break, and get them done quickly. If no, throw the list away. Now, the rest of your day is free. You can sit back, relax, and enjoy yourself. 2. Manage your work well We may have lots of work to do. But, some people are able to do more work than others. They don’t waste any time. They make the most of their time at school or at the office. They manage their work well. At the beginning of each day, think about what you need to do. Set yourself time limits for the things you have to do. Set yourself a start time. Set yourself a finish time. Work to the time limit. Then, take a short break! For example, you might decide to start a report or some homework at 9:00 a.m. You think it will take you 90 minutes to finish it. You work hard for ninety minutes. And, you finish the report or homework at 10:30 a.m. Well done! You did it. Now, it is time to take a break. Relax! Go for a coffee. Take a walk outside. Close your eyes and listen to some music. But, don’t forget to start work again after your break. Start the next thing you have to do on time. Work hard and finish it. Then, you can take a second break. 3. Work better, work less We may have lots of work to do. But, some people can finish their work more quickly than others. They find more productive ways to do things. They work better, so they work less. Then, they have more time to relax. Think about how you do your work. Can you think of better ways to do the things you need to do? Do you have lots of homework to do? Start with the most difficult homework task first. Save the easiest task until last. You will be more productive. You will finish more quickly. Do you have to make lots of copies for a meeting? Press the copy button on the photocopier. Then, do another job while the photocopier is copying your copies. It is more productive. Do you regularly have long meetings at work? Long meetings are not productive. They are a waste of time. Make them short. Stick to the main points. Stick to what you need to talk about only. Set a 30-minute time limit. Then, stop the meeting. If you still need to talk about things after that, use email. Remember, the more productive you are with your work, the more time you have to enjoy your life! 4. Make time for yourself We may get really busy from time to time. We may be busy all of the time. But, it is always important to schedule some “me time.” “Me time” is our own personal time to do the things that we want to do. Think about what you enjoy doing. Think about your hobbies. Think about how you relax. Now, think about how often you do these things every week. Do you schedule time for yourself? For a good work-life balance, you should. Do you want to sit on the couch and watch a movie? Schedule it for this evening. Do you want to learn to play the guitar? Make the time to do it. Do you want to get better at cooking? Go shopping. Schedule a morning to do some cooking, or bake some cakes. Do you want to cycle along the river? This weekend may be sunny. Plan to do it. Do you want to read a good book? Great, you’re already doing it! 5. Make time for your family and friends When we get busy, it is easy to just work, work, work. We can forget to spend time with our family and friends. They may ask us to do things with them. They may ask us to go somewhere with them. But, we may say, “Sorry, I can’t. I have too much work to do.” So, it is really important to schedule enjoyable things to do with them each week. Plan to go shopping with your family. Arrange to meet your friends in the city for a coffee. Go and watch a movie together. Have a house party. Another way is to start a hobby that you can do regularly with your family and friends. Make time to play tennis every weekend with your brother or sister. Learn to play music and make a rock band with your friends. Start a games club. Meet every week at somebody’s house to play video or board games together. Remember, it is important to stick to your plans. Always do them. Don’t change your plans because you are busy. You can always do some work before or after spending time with your family and friends. 6. Learn to let things go Every day, we may work and work until we finish everything we need to do. We may work from early in the morning. We may work until late at night. But, if we work all day, there is no time to enjoy life. We have no work-life balance. So, it is important to let things go. Set a time to stop working. Take some time to relax. Remember, your work will always be there the next day! You can start your work again in the morning. Also, we may always want our work to be perfect. So, we work and work, again and again trying for perfection. We may try to do a perfect homework task. We may try to write the perfect business report. We may try to prepare a perfect presentation. However, we can never be truly perfect. We can only do the best job with the time we have. So, it is important to let perfection go. Instead, do the best you can with your work, but enjoy your leisure time. Achieve Work-Life Balance 7. Switch things off We finish work or school. We get home. We want to sit down to eat some food. We want to watch a movie. We want to read a book. But then, our smartphones start making sounds. We have got new work emails or messages. We cannot relax. We may feel stressed. We feel that we must spend time reading them and replying to them. But should we? The simple answer is no. When you get home, switch off your smartphone. Switch off your tablet. Do not switch on your computer. Do not check your emails. Do not check your messages. People can wait until the next day for your reply. You can mail them in the morning. Relax. This is your time. Enjoy it. 8. Exercise We wake up in the morning. We hurry to get ready. Then, we go to work or school. When we finish work or school, we hurry to go home. We open the front door. We go inside, sit down, and we relax. But, it is important to schedule some exercise into our daily lives. Regular exercise can help us to achieve a better work-life balance. Exercise can help us to reduce our stress. It can make us feel great. It can give us power and energy. It can help us to work better and faster. Also, it can give us some time for thinking. So, wake up 30-minutes earlier every morning. Go for a short run or walk. You will feel ready for your day. And, you may think of some great ideas while exercising. When you get home in the evenings, don’t switch on the TV right away. Do some exercise at home for 30 minutes. Then, you can sit down and relax. And when you go to bed, you will even sleep better. 9. Do something you love Imagine you don’t like your job. Imagine you don’t like the subjects you are studying at school. Every day will feel like really hard work. Every day you will want more and more leisure time. But, maybe you can’t. After all, people have to work. And, people have to study. The Chinese philosopher, Confucius knew one of the best ways to achieve a good work-life balance. He said, “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” So, it is important to find a job you really enjoy. It is important to study a subject you really love. If you enjoy your job, it will never feel like you are really working. If you love your subject, you will enjoy studying more about it. Of course, you still need to schedule time to relax. You still need to have some free time. But, choosing the right job or choosing the right studies means working and studying is enjoyable. And, this makes life so much easier. 10. Make changes And finally, we may have to work. We may have to study. But, we shouldn’t work or study all the time. We shouldn’t work or study too much. A good work-life balance is really important. We need the time to spend with family and friends. We need the time to do our hobbies. We need the time to relax. If we can’t achieve a good work-life balance, we may feel unhappy. We may feel really stressed. We may feel really tired. Then, it is time for us to make big changes in our lives. For example, we could change jobs. Find a job that is less stressful. Find a job that gives us the time to enjoy life. We could change schools. We could take less subjects. Or, we could join fewer clubs. We could talk to our teacher about how we feel. At school, however, change is not always possible. So, we should remember, school is not forever! Making changes may be the most difficult way to achieve work-life balance. But, sometimes we may have to stop and think about what we do every day. We need to think about our regular work and our daily schedules. And, we may need to make some big changes to our regular lives. It really is up to us. The decision is ours to make. Summary Now, you have read the book, stop and think again. Do you think these ten ways can help you achieve a better work-life balance? Is it a good idea for you to manage your time well, so no time is wasted? Can you set time limits to manage your work well? Can you be more productive, so you can work less? Are you able to schedule time for yourself; time for you to relax? Can you schedule time to meet your family and friends? Can you learn to let things go; to not always try to be perfect? Would you feel less stressed by switching off your smartphone when you get home? Is it a good idea for you to exercise more and not always be in a hurry? And most importantly, are you doing something you really love? If not, are you ready to make important changes? After all, we all only get one life. It is up to each person how they choose to spend it.

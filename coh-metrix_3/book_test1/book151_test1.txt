Introduction The Internet has changed our lives in so many ways. Before the Internet, we could only buy things by going to stores. We usually only talked to people who lived near us. We used the telephone to talk to people far away. We read the morning newspaper to get the news. Now, we can go online using our smartphones and computers. We can buy things online. We can chat to people from all over the world. We can read the news online. We can do these things at any time of the day. Going online is great! However, there is also a lot of danger online. Some people may want to scam us. They want to steal our information. They want to steal our money. Hackers may try to give our computer a virus. They may get access to our email or social media. Some people post fake or incorrect news to try to spread wrong information. We have to be careful. We have to protect ourselves. We have to be smart to stay safe online. Now, stop and think for a moment. Do you worry about your information online? Do you worry about shopping online or visiting websites? Do you worry about becoming friends with people on social media? Do you worry about reading and sharing fake news articles? Let’s look at ten ways that you can be safer online: 1. Don’t choose a weak password A weak password is one that is easy for hackers to guess. If hackers guess your password, they can access your email or social media account. They can steal your information. The weakest passwords are: 123456, 12345678, Password, qwerty, letmein, hello, iloveyou, and welcome. The strongest passwords use UPPER CASE LETTERS, lower case letters, numbers, and other characters (For example – “#, $, or %”). They are also long. So, choose a strong password. Don’t use numbers from your birthday, address, or telephone number. It is also a good idea to use the first letters of each word in a sentence instead of a word. For example: !TaTwTbSo10! is a strong password. It uses the first letter of each word in this sentence: There are ten ways to be safe online. Some letters are upper case. Some letters are lower case. There are numbers. The numbers are not from a birthday, address, or telephone number. There are special characters at the beginning and end of the password - two exclamation points! This is a password that can keep you safe from hackers. 2. Don’t believe spam emails Spam emails are sent to many people at one time. In the email, the writer does not greet you by name. Maybe, they try to sell you something. Or, maybe, they say they want to give you lots and lots of money. It’s easy to know when you get a spam email. First, a spam email is from someone that you do not know. Then, look for spelling mistakes. Spam emails often have many words that aren’t spelled correctly. Finally, spam emails say things that are too good to be true. For example, why would someone you don’t know want to send you lots and lots of money? Why would someone you have never met want to do business with you? How can you protect yourself from spam emails? Don’t click on any links in the email. Don’t open any attachments in the email. Clicking on these links or opening these attachments may give your computer a virus. The best way to protect yourself from a spam mail is just to delete it. 3. Don’t believe phishing scams It is harder to know when an email is part of a phishing scam. In a phishing scam, someone tries to trick you. They trick you by sending you an email. Usually the email looks like it is from your bank. Sometimes it looks like it is from a famous company. These emails can look very real. However, phishing scams usually do not greet you by name. They will start the email with ‘Dear Customer.’ They will ask you to click on a link. Then, they will ask you to type in your credit card information. They may ask for your address or telephone number. Sometimes, they ask you for your passwords. In a phishing scam, someone is trying to get your information. If they get your information, they can steal your money! How can you protect yourself from phishing scams? Don’t click on any links in an email that doesn’t greet you by name. If the email looks like it is from a bank or company, visit their website instead of clicking on the link in the email. Finally, if you are still not sure, call the bank or company. You can check if the email is really from them. 4. Watch out if your friends get hacked You may get a strange email with an attachment from your friend. It might not look like something your friend would write. You receive a text message from your friend. Your friend asks you for money. Your friend posts a link to a video on social media. Your friend does not write anything to explain the video. When this happens, watch out! Somebody may have hacked your friend. Now, the hackers know how to contThey may try to steal your information, or give your computer a virus. What should you do? Contfriend and ask if somebody has hacked them. As with spam Instead, report them to your friend. Report them to the social media company. Then, delete them. Sometimes phishing scammers will send you an email. They will use one of your friend’s names. They will use your friend’s email address. They will say they have a big problem. They will say they need your help. Then, they will ask you to send them money. Do not send them money. Instead, contfriend. Tell your friend about this strange email. Find out if the email is real or a scam. 5. Don’t become online friends with people you don’t know A woman using social media became friends with a man she didn’t know. A few weeks later, she was very sad and posted about her problems. The man wrote a comment that made her feel happy. He left more and more nice comments on her posts. She thought the man was nice. She started to talk to him more and more. He said he was a successful businessperson. He took many business trips. They fell in love. He said they should meet. But, he was very busy with work. One day, he asked her for some money. Then, he asked for money again. He asked her for more and more money. She gave him lots and lots of money. However, one day, she found out that the man was not real! It was a scam. A scammer was writing the comments. The scammer tricked her. Be careful when becoming friends with people online. And, be very, very careful when it is somebody that you do not know. They might be nice people. Or, they might be people who want to scam you. They might want to get your information. They might want to steal your money. They might want to trick you, or do much worse! The best way to protect yourself is not to become online friends with people you don’t know. 6. Be a smart online shopper Shopping online is great. The stores are always open. And, you can stay at home to do your shopping. However, there are a few things you should remember to be safe. First of all, don’t do online shopping using unsecured WiFi. If you can access the WiFi without a password, hackers can steal your information. They can easily take it while you shop. Secondly, make sure the online store isn’t fake. There are many sad stories on the Internet. People buy things from online stores. But, the stores are fake. The people do not receive the things they have paid for. And, they cannot get their money back. How can you protect yourself from fake online shops? Don’t buy things from websites that pop up on your screen. Check the online store carefully. A real online store website address should start with “https”, instead of just “http.” A real online store should have an address and an email address. It should have a telephone number of the company written on the website. Also, see what other people say about the online store before buying anything. If there are many bad comments, don’t use the online store. Finally, make sure you can return things. Make sure you can get your money back if there is a problem. 7. Don’t believe fake news We can get so much information on the internet today. However, some of the information is true and some is not. Recently, there has been a big problem with fake news. Fake news can make us angry or sad. Because we are angry or sad, we may share the news before checking it. We may share it before we know if it is true or not. But, how can you check if information is really true and not fake news? If the information is part of a meme, search the Internet to see if the information is true. Often, only some of the information might be true, or the photograph in the meme may not be real. When you read a news article, don’t just read the headline. Read it all. In many fake news articles, the article is badly written. Sometimes, the headline and the rest of the article don’t even match! Also, check where the news came from. Is it from a newspaper? Is it from a magazine? Is it from a TV news channel? If it isn’t, check online to see if there are other articles about the same news story. If there are no other news articles, it is probably fake news. Finally, make sure the news article isn’t from a website, like ‘theonion.com.’ These kind of websites post fake news articles for fun. They want to make people laugh. 8. Protect your computer and the information on it We have a lot of important information on our computer. We may keep our work on it. We may keep our photographs on it. We may keep our friends’ conton it. However, we would have many problems if we lost all of this information. If we get a virus, we could lose all of our information. Hackers may try to give your computer a virus. If your computer has a virus, hackers can get your information. A virus can also make your computer stop working. It can make you lose all the information on it. It costs a lot of money to get that information back. Put virus protection software on your computer. And, use it regularly. However, your computer can get a virus even if you use virus protection software. So, it is a good idea to back up your computer regularly. When you back up your computer, you make a copy of the information on it. You put the copy somewhere safe. If you have a problem with your computer, you have a copy of all your information. You will not lose anything. Backing up your computer regularly will save you time and money. 9. Don’t give out your private information Hackers try to steal our information. Sometimes, however, they don’t have to try too hard. This is because people often post their private information on social media. This can be a big problem. If we are not careful, people we do not know can get this information. They can see it and read it. To be safe online, do not post any private information on the Internet: • Do not post your birth year. Many social media sites let everyone know when it is your birthday. But, don’t say how old you are. Hackers can know what year you were born. They could use this information to steal your money. • Do not post your home address. This makes it easy for people to find your house. You might post about going away on vacation. Somebody might come to your house! They might break in and steal your things. • Do not post your telephone number. Anyone can call you! • Do not post your passwords. Also, don’t choose a weak password. It is easy for people to guess it. For example, you may choose your dog’s name. Then, you post on social media about your pet. Everybody knows your dog’s name! • Do not post any information that your bank uses as a security question. Some banks may ask you about the name of your first pet. They may ask you your mother’s name before she got married. 10. Watch what you post on social media There are many good things about social media. We can let family and friends know what we are doing. We can share photographs. We can find people who enjoy the same things we do. We can also speak out when we think the world needs to change. However, you have to be careful about sharing things with the world on social media. There are many stories of people who posted an angry comment or bad photograph. Their bosses saw the posts. And, the people lost their jobs. Also, companies may check posts or photographs on social media. So, you may post angry comments or bad photographs. But then, you can lose your chance of getting a job with the company. So, to be safe online, never post a photograph that you wouldn’t want your boss to see. Don’t use the Internet when you are angry. If you wouldn’t say the words to someone in person, don’t post them on social media. Remember, anyone can see the things you post on Twitter, Instagram, or public Facebook posts. You may post something just for your friends. But, they can take it and post it publicly. Anybody on the Internet can see the post. And, your post will be there for years to come. Anything posted on the Internet is forever. Summary Now that you have read the book, stop and think again.

No rest for Spiegel “We’re ready.” Despite his excitement, Detective Max Spiegel’s voice was calm and controlled. “Make sure your men are hidden,” he told the Italian policeman beside him. “I don’t want them to scare the dealer away. They must let him enter the building, but then no one is to leave. Is that clear?” “You’ve found the painting, Detective,” answered the policeman. “I believe that means your job here is finished.” He was one of the most senior officers in the city of Naples and he didn’t like taking orders from a foreigner, especially a foreigner who was from the Serious Art Crime Office. “Go back to Basel. Let us deal with the situation now.” Spiegel said nothing. His eyes never moved from the building across the street. “We know these men,” continued the policeman. “We’ve been after them for a long time and they do not usually limit themselves to stealing paintings. They are not just art thieves. They are dangerous criminals. It would be safer for you to return home.” Still Spiegel said nothing. The policeman wasn’t used to being ignored. He was growing angry. “This is a time for real policemen, Spiegel, not museum guides like you. We do not need your help.” At last Spiegel turned to the Italian with a hard smile. “If that were true,” he replied, “then I would now be sitting comfortably at home, eating my dinner. But instead I find myself wasting my time listening to you. And that is precisely because your men cannot do their job. You were in charge of security at the church when the painting was stolen. Perhaps you should remember that.” The Italian policeman had no answer. He stood in uncomfortable silence while Spiegel continued, “Believe me, I do not want to be here any longer than it is necessary. So, please, do as I ask. Tell your men to stay hidden and to wait for my sign. These thieves will be in jail within the hour. Then, if you like, you can claim all the credit. It will help to make up for your earlier mistakes. But if anything happens to the painting, I will tell everyone why it was so easily stolen and why this operation was not successful.” The policeman looked as though he was going to say something. Then, without a word, he turned away. At that moment, another man approached. “Detective?” “What is it now?” asked Spiegel. “You have a phone call.” “I have no time for calls.” “It’s someone from Paris, Detective. He says his name is Ulrich.” Spiegel sighed. “All right,” he said. With another quick look at the building across the street, he followed the man into a nearby office. A telephone sat on the desk. “Listen, Uli,” said Spiegel, picking up the phone. “I can’t talk now. We’ve got the thieves surrounded. We’re about to make the arrest. The painting will be back in the church by the end of the day.” “Forget it.” “What?!” Spiegel pressed the phone closer to his ear. It was a long way from Naples to the Serious Art Crime Office in Paris. “I said forget it,” his boss repeated. “You’ve done all the hard work. Let the Italian police deal with it from here.” “These men have already escaped the Italian police three times! I’ve chased them around Naples for a week, and now that they’re caught in a corner you want me to just walk away?” “There’s something else I need you to do.” Spiegel’s eyes were beginning to hurt. He hadn’t slept in forty-eight hours. “This job was my last. You promised. I’m getting too old to run around Europe chasing after stolen art.” “This is important, Max. We need you for this one. You need to get back to Basel. Fast.” “Is this about the van Gogh sale?” “Exactly.” “What’s happened?” “It seems your contacts were right. I just got a call from the art dealer, Herr Kreine. He’s managing the auction. He’s heard the whispers himself about The Ghost and now he wants us involved.” “I warned him four weeks ago! The Yellow Field will be too tempting. The Ghost is sure to try to steal it.” “Herr Kreine is under a lot of pressure, Max. This is going to be one of the biggest art sales of the century. He wants it to demonstrate his ability to do business, not The Ghost’s ability to frighten the entire art industry!” “So he’s given us forty-eight hours to organize the security! Even Kreine knows that the preparation for these international sales usually takes weeks.” “That’s why we need you, Max. You’re the best we’ve got. Besides, you always said you would catch The Ghost one day. How can you do that if you retire? This offers you one last chance. There’s a jet leaving for Basel at eight o’clock. I’ve got you a seat.” Spiegel sighed. He hated flying, especially in jet planes. They were faster and quieter than normal planes, perhaps. But they were also new, an invention of the Second World War that had ended only five years before. And because they were new and because he didn’t understand how they worked, Spiegel didn’t trust them. That meant he couldn’t relax. And that would mean he wouldn’t sleep, despite already being so tired. “All right, Uli. But this is definitely my last job. Tell Kreine I’ll be with him first thing tomorrow.” “Thanks, Max. And there’s one other thing.” Spiegel waited. “I’m sending someone else with you. An English woman called Miranda Knapp. She’s just transferred to us from a big insurance company in Zürich.” “I work alone. You know that.” “Not this time, Max. She’s been asking to help with the van Gogh sale for weeks. Besides, you’re leaving us after this. So let her learn from you. You’ll like her. I promise.” “I don’t have time to look after . . .” Spiegel stopped. The phone line was dead. His boss had gone before they could have an argument. Spiegel angrily shook his head. Uli had said that he would like her. But after thirty years of working together, Spiegel knew when he was lying. The auction house “I’m sure I don’t need to tell you what this painting is worth,” said Herr Kreine. He and Spiegel were standing in the main hall of Basel’s ancient Kreine and Halske auction house. In front of them on the wall was The Yellow Field by Vincent van Gogh. Herr Kreine, the owner of the auction house, was tall and thin and dressed in an expensive suit that made Spiegel’s old clothes look even worse. He was only a few years older than the detective, perhaps as old as seventy. But like so many people who had survived the war, he looked much older than his actual age. He had a habit of looking down his large nose whenever he was speaking. He reminded Spiegel of a teacher, a very worried teacher. “I understand that the estimate is four million Swiss francs,” answered Spiegel. Despite his lack of sleep, his voice was alert and bright. “And while that might seem hopeful to some, I believe it is achievable. The market for works by van Gogh is especially strong at the moment. The big London auction houses have sold two in the last eighteen months, and both sold for almost double their initial estimates.” Kreine nodded as Spiegel continued. “There’s also the fthe two sold in London were early works, while this is one of van Gogh’s last. And it’s in the style that has made him one of the most popular artists of the last century.” “I’m impressed with your knowledge,” said Kreine. Spiegel put down his old leather briefcase and stepped closer, to where he could see each individual line of paint. “It is a beautiful work: the field blowing in the wind, so bright that it’s almost on fire. But the dark clouds above suggesting the trouble in van Gogh’s mind.” “You know your business, I can see that,” said Kreine. “So let me tell you a little about mine. We are a small auction house, Detective Spiegel, but this sale will make us big. The world is watching us. So we have to show that we are in control, and not scared by talk of The Ghost or anyone else.” “I understand, Herr Kreine.” “Then you will also understand that while I want tight security, I do not want this event destroyed by fear. It wasn’t my idea to call the Serious Art Crime Office, or ‘SACO’ as my insurers insist on calling you. It was they who demanded your involvement. It seems they are prepared to take these whispers about The Ghost seriously.” Kreine stepped protectively even closer to the van Gogh. “This painting has been in a private collection for sixty years,” he continued. “Vincent van Gogh himself gave the painting to the family who is selling it now. And now, for the first time, it will be on public display for just a few hours before the auction begins. We expect not just thousands of people, but the whole of the art world.” It was clear that Kreine was desperate for the sale to be a success, and Spiegel knew why. The sale was more important to Kreine and Halske than the old man was revealing. After working for so many years in the art world, Spiegel knew all of the museums, all of the galleries, and all of the auction houses. He knew which ones were respected and which ones were truly respectable. And he knew which ones were doing well and which ones were struggling. Kreine and Halske was one of the oldest auction houses in Europe, but it had been years since they had sold anything of significance. And in these difficult years, with the world still recovering from a war that had affected more people than any other in history, the art business was suffering especially badly. The van Gogh painting could make or break Kreine and Halske. If the sale went well, Herr Kreine’s business would be secure. If not, he faced a very difficult future. “We want to be proud of this incredible work of art,” Kreine continued, “and proud of this auction house. I’m meeting with journalists from all over the western world to raise awareness of this sale. This afternoon I will be interviewed by the Bern Times, and I do not want our story to be all about . . .” “Who is interviewing you?” asked Spiegel suddenly, fearing the answer he knew would come. “Marc Bardieu!” answered Herr Kreine, proudly. “I told them I would only speak to their top art reporter.” Spiegel tried to hide his anger. He knew Bardieu all too well. The French reporter always seemed more interested in the value of a piece of art than in the art itself. And he liked nothing better than a story about a high-value art theft. As a result, Bardieu often appeared whenever and wherever The Ghost had appeared. He would arrive at the each crime almost as soon as it had happened, and immediately start to bother the police with his questions. Then, when his article was published, it made the police and often SACO look stupid. Naturally, Spiegel was never happy to see him. “I have to ask you, Herr Kreine, please don’t mention anything about your security here to Bardieu. He has a habit of learning more than he should and then reporting it to all of his readers. And we don’t want to give The Ghost any information about your arrangements.” “You needn’t worry about that, Detective,” answered Herr Kreine. “I have no wish to link this sale with any mention of The Ghost.” Spiegel was about to reply when a voice came from behind them. “Surely you don’t believe in ghosts, Herr Kreine?” Spiegel’s new assistant Spiegel and Kreine both turned to see who had spoken. Behind them stood a young woman of no more than thirty. She was dressed expensively, in a jacket and straight skirt as black as her long hair. She was very attractive and stood with confidence, as though she knew it. “I’m Miranda Knapp,” she said. Spiegel remembered that she was English, but her German seemed perfect. She pulled off a spotless white glove and shook Herr Kreine’s hand. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Herr Kreine. I’ve been sent by SACO to help Herr Spiegel.” Spiegel didn’t like any suggestion that he needed help. He also felt very messy in comparison to the woman’s appearance. But he forced himself to smile warmly. “Welcome to Basel, Miss Knapp,” he said in English. “Thank you,” she replied, then immediately turned back to Kreine and continued in German. “As I was saying, sir, we won’t allow a few silly stories to affect this sale. A wonderful painting like this,” she pointed toward the van Gogh, “should receive the very best protection. And that is exactly what SACO offers. I can promise you that this auction will be a great success.” “Excellent,” answered Kreine. He seemed very impressed with her and her promise. “Then I shall leave you to prepare the security. You will understand I have a lot to do.” Spiegel watched Kreine disappear through a side door, then turned to Knapp. He was no longer smiling. “Why did you tell Herr Kreine that there is no Ghost? If he doesn’t take the situation seriously, our work here will only be harder.” “There is no Ghost. There are only excuses.” “I can promise you, Miss Knapp, that The Ghost is very real. I’m certain I’ve come close to catching him twice.” “Him?” “I beg your pardon?” “You said ‘him.’ But The Ghost could be a woman. Isn’t that right?” Spiegel had no choice but to nod. “It’s possible.” Miranda Knapp smiled. It was obviously a smile used for making friends. “You see? There have been reports of this Ghost for almost three years now. And you are the one policeman who has come closest to catching the thief. Yet even the celebrated Detective Max Spiegel doesn’t know if The Ghost is a man or a woman. No one knows anything!” “That means only that The Ghost is clever. It doesn’t mean that he—or she—doesn’t exist. What about the Chinese gold lamp stolen from Geneva last May? And the Strozzi oil painting taken from the Church of San Beneto in Venice just two months ago?” “In both cases, the thieves were clever, that’s true. Cleverer than the local police, certainly. But that doesn’t mean it was the same single person each time. The methods used were so different. The Ghost is just an excuse for bad police work. It’s the same all over Europe: the local police create a character impossible to catch so they can give the job to SACO and escape all blame for their failure!” Spiegel forced himself to control his anger. Of course, he agreed that too often the police were unable to deal with art crime the way they should. But he was Europe’s leading art detective, and here was a beginner telling him that he was wrong, and that The Ghost didn’t exist. On top of that, she was offering false guarantees to his client. “Your approach to art crime has been very different from mine, Miss Knapp. You have worked in insurance, I believe?” “So?” “So every theft is bad for the insurance business. If a work of art is stolen, you lose money. It is therefore natural that you are angry every time there is a theft, and angry with the people you believe have allowed it to happen. And that, of course, is usually the police. So I understand your attitude. But you would be wrong to judge us from the safety of your comfortable office chair.” “I’m not in that office now. And I still say that stories about The Ghost are simply excuses. I intend to prove it.” “I don’t have time to argue with you, Miss Knapp. Whether you believe in The Ghost or not, we have security to arrange and very little time to do it. You’re here to learn from me, I believe. So I suggest you let me work. If you want to be useful, please speak to Herr Kreine’s office. I need to know the name and business of everyone who comes into this building.” Without another word, Spiegel pulled a measuring tape from his old briefcase and began to carefully examine the hall. The risk grows “I’m sorry, Herr Kreine,” said Spiegel, less than half an hour later. “This building is just not suitable. I strongly recommend that you display the painting elsewhere.” Herr Kreine was far from happy at the suggestion. “This building has hosted art sales for almost two hundred years! It was my father who helped introduce Claude Monet to the world. Paul Klee himself sat in this very office! Don’t tell me that this building is not suitable. We’ve been involved in the sale of work by some of Europe’s greatest-ever artists. And we have never had a problem.” “You’ve never sold a van Gogh, Herr Kreine. And you’ve never been targeted by The Ghost. You’ve brought me here, and my advice is that you must hold the sale elsewhere.” “But why?” Herr Kreine sounded almost afraid of the idea. It would be a clear admission that his business was unable to handle such an important international sale. Spiegel softened his voice so he didn’t sound unkind. “This is 1950, Herr Kreine. But the security in your building dates from the 1930s! Your few guards are old and poorly prepared for an event like this. The glass in your windows is thin and easy to cut, and the locks are at least ten years out of date. It’s the same with the doors; they are far too basic for a modern thief. Your alarm is more modern, but still not good enough to stop someone like The Ghost. You keep no record of the vehicles leaving your car park. And then there is this list. Miss Knapp?” He turned to Knapp. She held out a sheet of paper as Spiegel continued. “This list shows all of the people who can freely enter and leave not just your building, but this hall. It includes your employees, guards, and cleaning, kitchen, and maintenance staff.” He pointed around the hall. A security guard stood by the main door talking to a secretary. Two women were cleaning the floor. One man was cleaning the windows, while another was working on the lights. “No doubt there will be many more involved when the auction begins. Have you carried out proper security checks on them all? Do you know their backgrounds?” Slowly, Herr Kreine shook his head. “And I’m afraid that there is an even stronger argument for moving the sale elsewhere.” “What is that?” Spiegel turned back to the van Gogh. “Because you clearly don’t understand the risk you’re taking. If you were serious about security, this painting would not be here now. It should be safely locked away until only minutes before the auction begins.” “But it is chained to the wall in three places!” replied the older man. “Herr Kreine, the painting’s frame is chained to the wall. But in a large number of art thefts, the painting is simply cut out of the frame. It takes less than a minute. I’m sure you have confidence in your staff and your building, but please believe me. You’re making it too easy for The Ghost.” Herr Kreine looked miserable. Spiegel knew what he was thinking. “We can tell the newspapers that you have decided to move to a bigger hall because the sale is so popular,” the detective said. “We don’t need to mention the security.” “And where do you suggest we hold the auction instead? It would have to be somewhere here in Basel. There’s no time to go anywhere else.” “The obvious place is the Kunstmuseum. It’s the largest museum in the country and the only building with suitable security for a painting of such value. It’s also the only place likely to be able to organize itself in time. I teach classes there, so I know the curator, Frau Estler. She would have to speak to the board in charge, but I’m sure I could arrange it. With your permission, of course.” Spiegel and Knapp waited in silence for Kreine to answer. The old man was looking at the floor and nodding slowly, as if in sad agreement. Then he stopped. He seemed to have thought of something else. Finally, he stood straight, and spoke directly to Spiegel as though the detective was no more than a schoolboy. “We don’t know for sure that the painting is being targeted. You two can’t even agree on whether or not The Ghost exists! So I’m not going to allow a few rumors to move the greatest sale in my company’s history to the Kunstmuseum. The auction will take place right here, in this hall. My insurers have already approved it. If there is a security problem, SACO will be to blame, and I’ll hold you both responsible. So do whatever is necessary to ensure it proceeds safely. But it’ll be hosted by Kreine and Halske, and no one else!” Without another word, Kreine stormed out of the hall. A first sign of The Ghost Spiegel watched Kreine go in silence, then turned to Knapp. He didn’t need to say anything; his anger was obvious. Knapp’s face darkened instantly. “Don’t look at me like that! I only told him he shouldn’t believe in The Ghost. I didn’t say there wasn’t any risk!” Spiegel shook his head. “He’s making a big mistake. His business needs to be linked to a successful sale; I understand that. But he might find it’s linked instead to the biggest art theft of all time!” “Perhaps he’s not too worried,” said Knapp. “Kreine could actually make more money if the painting is stolen.” “Forgive me, Miss Knapp, but that is a foolish thing to say.” Knapp only smiled. “Until last month, I worked in insurance.” “So I heard.” “And that’s how I know that Kreine has bought the right to own the van Gogh if it’s stolen during the sale.” Spiegel paused. “What do you mean?” “You know that the van Gogh is insured for four million francs, don’t you?” “Of course. But if the painting is stolen, Herr Kreine won’t benefit. The insurers will have to pay four million francs to the family that owns the painting.” “That’s right. But from the moment it pays that money, the insurance company becomes the legal owner of the painting.” Spiegel laughed. “There’s no point owning a painting if no one knows where that painting is! That doesn’t sound like the insurance company has a very good deal.” “That’s the nature of insurance. It’s always a risk. But listen. If the van Gogh is stolen, the insurance company becomes the legal owner of the painting. That gives them the right to sell it to someone else.” “I’m sorry, Miss Knapp, but you’re wasting my time. No one can sell a painting they don’t have.” “You’re wrong. Even if you can’t sell the painting itself, you can sell the right to own it. The insurers can’t ask for the full value of the painting, of course. But they will have a legal document that shows they own the stolen artwork. And they can sell that document, even if it’s only for a small percentage of the painting’s original value.” “So?” “Think about it. If the painting is stolen, the insurance company has to pay the family four million francs. That’s a lot of money, a huge loss. And they will be happy to reduce that loss, even if only a little. Like any other business, an insurance company wants money. They don’t want a collection of documents saying that they own a stolen art collection.” “So they reduce their loss by selling the right to own the stolen painting?” “Exactly.” “And you think Kreine has made an agreement with the insurers to buy that right if the van Gogh is stolen?” “I know he has.” “But that’s a huge risk! Whatever he pays for that document, it’s worthless if the painting is never found.” “Of course. But you tell me: how many paintings as famous as The Yellow Field are never found again?” Spiegel nodded. “It’s true that thieves find famous paintings very difficult to sell. The paintings are often found within a year or two. Either we catch the thieves, or they try to arrange to sell it back to the original owner. But in forty years of policing, I’ve never heard of an insurer selling a document like that. Is it common?” “It has happened before, but only a couple of times. That’s why I heard about it this time. Kreine is clever. Whatever happens, he can’t lose! If the sale goes well, his business will be saved: he will make a lot of money in commission, and his auction house will rise to the top of the art industry.” “And if the painting is stolen?” “Then he becomes the legal owner of the painting. The Yellow Field will be his! He just needs to wait for it to reappear, then he can sell it himself. And then he’ll be able to keep all of the money. He could actually make more money if the van Gogh is stolen.” “But while he’s waiting for us to find it, his business will suffer.” “Perhaps. And we may never find it. That’s the risk that he’s taking. But it sounds like he’s close to losing his business anyway. But if the painting sells successfully, he’ll get back more in commission than it cost him to pay the insurers. And if it’s stolen, he could become the legal owner of the painting. So whether it’s stolen or not, he’ll be able to retire happily.” Spiegel stood in silence, thinking it through. “There’s another thing,” continued Knapp. “More important than the money, this gives Kreine the chance for his company to get back what it has lost and is missing so much: the respect of the art world. If the sale goes well, Kreine and Halske will no longer be a forgotten auction house living off its past. It will still be one of the oldest auction houses in the world, but it will also be the most modern. The company’s image will change in a moment. And right now, Kreine and Halske needs a fresh, renewed image far more than it needs a few hundred thousand francs. If their image is right, the money will follow. After all, if you were selling a painting of international importance, would you take it to the auction house that the world is talking about? Or would you take it to a dusty old company that once sold a few important paintings over one hundred years ago?” Spiegel nodded. “So you think that’s why Kreine is insisting on holding the auction here? So that there’s more chance of it being stolen and he can finally close his company and retire with millions? That’s difficult to believe.” “But it’s possible, isn’t it?” Spiegel considered it for a moment, and then shook his head. “Kreine might be willing to take that risk, but I’m not. I’m not going to end my career being beaten by The Ghost.” “Whoever it is, someone is almost certainly planning to steal the painting,” said Knapp. “What do you want to do?” “All we can. I’ll speak to my boss. We need to bring in people we can trust, to keep a close eye on the painting until it’s out of our hands.” “You said you teach at the Kunstmuseum?” “On art security.” Knapp stood, thinking. “So how would you steal this painting?” “That depends.” “On what?” “On how violent I wanted to be. Two or three men with guns could walk in right now and there would be nothing we could do to stop them.” Spiegel was amused to see Knapp look quickly toward the door. “But then they would have to escape, and that’s not so easy in the middle of a city when we’re only minutes behind.” “So you would try to steal the painting in secret, without anyone knowing?” “Perhaps. But that’s not easy either if there’s a guard all through the night.” “So?” “The risk is highest when works of art are traveling between museums or collections. That’s when a thief has the most opportunities. If I . . .” “Excuse me.” Spiegel turned to see who had spoken. It was one of the cleaning women. “Are you a policeman?” she asked. Spiegel forced himself to control his anger. Of course, he agreed that too often the police were unable to deal with art crime the way they should. But he was Europe’s leading art detective, and here was a beginner telling him that he was wrong, and that The Ghost didn’t exist.

But from the moment it pays that money, the insurance company becomes the legal owner of the painting.” Spiegel laughed. “There’s no point owning a painting if no one knows where that painting is! That doesn’t sound like the insurance company has a very good deal.” “That’s the nature of insurance. It’s always a risk. But listen. If the van Gogh is stolen, the insurance company becomes the legal owner of the painting. That gives them the right to sell it to someone else.” “I’m sorry, Miss Knapp, but you’re wasting my time. No one can sell a painting they don’t have.” “You’re wrong. Even if you can’t sell the painting itself, you can sell the right to own it. The insurers can’t ask for the full value of the painting, of course. But they will have a legal document that shows they own the stolen artwork. And they can sell that document, even if it’s only for a small percentage of the painting’s original value.” “So?” “Think about it. If the painting is stolen, the insurance company has to pay the family four million francs. That’s a lot of money, a huge loss. And they will be happy to reduce that loss, even if only a little. Like any other business, an insurance company wants money. They don’t want a collection of documents saying that they own a stolen art collection.” “So they reduce their loss by selling the right to own the stolen painting?” “Exactly.” “And you think Kreine has made an agreement with the insurers to buy that right if the van Gogh is stolen?” “I know he has.” “But that’s a huge risk! Whatever he pays for that document, it’s worthless if the painting is never found.” “Of course. But you tell me: how many paintings as famous as The Yellow Field are never found again?” Spiegel nodded. “It’s true that thieves find famous paintings very difficult to sell. The paintings are often found within a year or two. Either we catch the thieves, or they try to arrange to sell it back to the original owner. But in forty years of policing, I’ve never heard of an insurer selling a document like that. Is it common?” “It has happened before, but only a couple of times. That’s why I heard about it this time. Kreine is clever. Whatever happens, he can’t lose! If the sale goes well, his business will be saved: he will make a lot of money in commission, and his auction house will rise to the top of the art industry.” “And if the painting is stolen?” “Then he becomes the legal owner of the painting. The Yellow Field will be his! He just needs to wait for it to reappear, then he can sell it himself. And then he’ll be able to keep all of the money. He could actually make more money if the van Gogh is stolen.” “But while he’s waiting for us to find it, his business will suffer.” “Perhaps. And we may never find it. That’s the risk that he’s taking. But it sounds like he’s close to losing his business anyway. But if the painting sells successfully, he’ll get back more in commission than it cost him to pay the insurers. And if it’s stolen, he could become the legal owner of the painting. So whether it’s stolen or not, he’ll be able to retire happily.” Spiegel stood in silence, thinking it through. “There’s another thing,” continued Knapp. “More important than the money, this gives Kreine the chance for his company to get back what it has lost and is missing so much: the respect of the art world. If the sale goes well, Kreine and Halske will no longer be a forgotten auction house living off its past. It will still be one of the oldest auction houses in the world, but it will also be the most modern. The company’s image will change in a moment. And right now, Kreine and Halske needs a fresh, renewed image far more than it needs a few hundred thousand francs. If their image is right, the money will follow. After all, if you were selling a painting of international importance, would you take it to the auction house that the world is talking about? Or would you take it to a dusty old company that once sold a few important paintings over one hundred years ago?” Spiegel nodded. “So you think that’s why Kreine is insisting on holding the auction here? So that there’s more chance of it being stolen and he can finally close his company and retire with millions? That’s difficult to believe.” “But it’s possible, isn’t it?” Spiegel considered it for a moment, and then shook his head. “Kreine might be willing to take that risk, but I’m not. I’m not going to end my career being beaten by The Ghost.” “Whoever it is, someone is almost certainly planning to steal the painting,” said Knapp. “What do you want to do?” “All we can. I’ll speak to my boss. We need to bring in people we can trust, to keep a close eye on the painting until it’s out of our hands.” “You said you teach at the Kunstmuseum?” “On art security.” Knapp stood, thinking. “So how would you steal this painting?” “That depends.” “On what?” “On how violent I wanted to be. Two or three men with guns could walk in right now and there would be nothing we could do to stop them.” Spiegel was amused to see Knapp look quickly toward the door. “But then they would have to escape, and that’s not so easy in the middle of a city when we’re only minutes behind.” “So you would try to steal the painting in secret, without anyone knowing?” “Perhaps. But that’s not easy either if there’s a guard all through the night.” “So?” “The risk is highest when works of art are traveling between museums or collections. That’s when a thief has the most opportunities. If I . . .” “Excuse me.” Spiegel turned to see who had spoken. It was one of the cleaning women. “Are you a policeman?” she asked. Obviously Spiegel’s slightly messy appearance made her doubtful. He nodded. “That’s right.” “Can I show you something?” The woman led them to the far side of the hall, where the wall had been lined with chairs. “I was wiping them clean, you see. And when I got to this one,” she pointed to a chair beneath one of the windows, “this fell off when I touched it. Here.” She picked something up from the nearest chair. “It was taped to the bottom,” she said. “Isn’t that strange? Why would anyone tape a knife to the bottom of a chair?” Kreine has no choice “Where are you going?” called Knapp. Spiegel was walking quickly across the hall, his briefcase in one hand, the knife in the other, now safely wrapped in a handkerchief. If there were any marks on the knife from whoever touched it last, Spiegel didn’t want to lose them. “I’m going to see Kreine,” he called back over his shoulder. “He needs to know about this. It confirms that someone is targeting the auction, and that someone is most likely to be The Ghost. This will persuade him to move the sale to the Kunstmuseum.” “Wait!” Knapp ran quickly after him. The cleaning woman remained beside the chairs. She looked confused. “Think!” whispered Knapp urgently. As she spoke, she pushed Spiegel’s hand down so that the knife was hidden from view. “We know that Kreine wants the auction to be here, not in the museum. He’s prepared to take that risk. And if there really is a Ghost, we now know how he’s planning to steal the painting. Do you see? We can use that information to catch him!” Spiegel held up the knife again. “You want to deliberately put the painting at risk for a chance to catch The Ghost?” “Shouldn’t we try? Whether it’s really The Ghost or not, someone is planning to steal The Yellow Field. And now we know enough to stop them. We only have to put that knife back where we found it and wait.” “How can you be sure? What if this knife is intended to trick us? Perhaps we were meant to find it, and The Ghost is planning a different method. Surely he would have known that we would search the hall.” “You believe in The Ghost, and you’ve been after him for years,” answered Knapp. “Everyone knows that. And now, at last, you have a chance to catch him. Why don’t you want to take that chance? What better way could there be to end your career?” “Or to start yours, you mean!” Spiegel was angry now. “This is not about personal ambition, Miss Knapp. And the decision isn’t ours. It’s our duty to inform Herr Kreine. You can suggest your plan to him if you wish, but it has to be his choice. Guard!” he called to the nearest man. “Please ask Herr Kreine to come here.” Knapp was clearly angry. She stood in silence until, moments later, Herr Kreine appeared. “Well?” he asked. “Is everything prepared?” “Herr Kreine,” began Spiegel. He took the man to the center of the room where no one else would hear them. “I’m afraid that we do now have confirmation of a specific risk to The Yellow Field.” “What do you mean?” “You remember, I’m sure, when I told you that the easiest way to steal a painting is to cut it from its frame?” Kreine nodded. Spiegel held out his hand. “This was found taped under one of the chairs over there.” For a moment, Kreine looked confused. Then, when he realized the object in Spiegel’s hand was a knife, his face turned pale. For a moment, he looked as though he might fall over. “We will perform the usual tests,” said Spiegel, “to see if we can tell who has touched it recently. But that could take several days. And even then we might not learn anything.” He waited in silence for Kreine’s reaction, but it was Knapp who spoke first. “Herr Kreine,” she said, “this does not mean that we have to move the auction to the Kunstmuseum.” Kreine seemed too shocked to speak, so Knapp continued. “We have another option. We could replace the knife under the chair, and use it to catch The Ghost. We now know what he’s planning!” When Kreine at last spoke, his voice was low and quiet. “That is out of the question.” “But the risk to you is small! I know that you’ve bought the right to be the new owner if the painting is stolen.” Kreine looked at her sharply. “That is not public knowledge. Who told you?” “It’s our job to know everything possible about a sale of art,” answered Knapp. “That sort of information can help us considerably.” Spiegel noticed how easily she used that knowledge to make herself look good. “I bought that right as insurance of my own,” said Kreine, clearly angry. “But that does not mean I want to have to claim it!” His voice was getting louder. “You will note that it is my name above the door, Miss Knapp. So of course I want to host the auction here, in our building. But it is a business that is almost two hundred years old. I am not going to risk linking it to the theft of a van Gogh when we know of a specific risk!” He turned to Spiegel. “I can now see that we don’t have a choice, Detective. You must contKunstmuseum at once, and I’ll advise the insurers and the owners of the painting. The auction will be held there instead.” The reporter Five minutes later, Spiegel thanked the curator of the Kunstmuseum and then put down the phone. The two detectives stepped out of the main door of Kreine and Halske. Knapp was clearly still angry at losing the opportunity to prepare a trap. “Frau Estler and Herr Kreine have come to an agreement,” said Spiegel, his briefcase in hand. “The auction will take place in the Kunstmuseum, but Kreine and Halske will still be the official hosts. Their next task will be to decide which of the Kunstmuseum’s many halls will be best.” “Have you thought about that?” asked Knapp. “I’ve an idea, but it will be up to Frau Estler and Herr Kreine to decide, and he’s now busy confirming the move with the insurers and informing the newspapers. If we . . .” “Detective Spiegel!” The shout came from a handsome young man on the front steps. He was dressed perfectly in expensive clothes, like someone out of a movie. “Bardieu,” sighed Spiegel. He clearly wasn’t happy to see the reporter. “You’re here to interview Herr Kreine?” “I’d be happy to get a comment from you first.” “You know I don’t talk to journalists.” “What about you, Miranda?” asked the reporter. “Will you talk to me?” “You two know each other?” asked Spiegel, surprised. “We . . .” started Bardieu, but Knapp talked over him. “We’ve met before,” she said. “The art world is small, after all.” There was a very brief silence. Spiegel thought Knapp looked a little uncomfortable. She was obviously hiding something about her relationship with the reporter. But why? And was that relationship in the past, or still continuing? Spiegel couldn’t tell. He looked at Bardieu for his reaction, but the reporter only smiled as though Knapp had made a joke. “That’s true,” Bardieu nodded. “The art world is certainly a small world. So what do you think, Miranda? Do you want to comment? Will The Ghost make an appearance?” “I’m sure you will be the first to tell everyone if he does,” answered Spiegel. His dislike was clear, but Bardieu only continued to smile. “My job’s like yours, Detective,” the journalist said. “I’m paid to discover all I can.” “And then publish everything you’ve learned! And I fear it’s likely that The Ghost can read as well as anyone. Is there any point asking you once again to limit what you report about the security here?” “I only report what anyone else could easily discover.” “But they don’t need to, do they? Because you offer the information like a gift.” Still Bardieu only smiled. “Perhaps you don’t like me, Detective, because I remind my readers of your failure to catch The Ghost.” “Sure, you like to mention me in your reports. But you’d better hope I don’t start mentioning you in mine. Perhaps I should be investigating exactly how you seem to know about every major art theft within minutes of it happening? Wherever it is, in whatever corner of Europe, you’re there before anyone else, asking questions and writing your articles. Is someone on the police force feeding you information?” “It works both ways, Spiegel. If you help me with my job and give me a comment now and again, I might be able to help you with yours.” “I doubt that.” “No? I deal in information, remember. And information is often very useful.” Spiegel looked carefully at the journalist. He clearly didn’t trust him. “What information do you have?” “Well,” said Bardieu, pretending to think. “For instance, I could tell you who has been taking an interest in the auction house this morning.” “Who?” Bardieu pointed to the door of a jeweler across the street. “He only left about ten minutes ago. I’ve no idea how long he was watching this place. Or why.” “Well?” Bardieu smiled, enjoying his advantage. “An old friend of yours. I went across to ask him for a comment for my story. But the minute he realized I knew who he was, he ran away.” “Are you going to tell me who you’re talking about?” asked Spiegel, angrily. He didn’t like the game that Bardieu was playing. The reporter’s smile grew wide. Then at last he said, “Zaun.” “Patrick Zaun?” “Do you know any other?” laughed Bardieu, but Spiegel was already running back into the auction house. Puzzled, Miranda Knapp followed close behind. Preparing the Dutch room “Who is Patrick Zaun?” called Knapp, as she ran after Spiegel. “He’s a local artist. I’ve known him for years. I first arrested him in the 1920s.” “For what?” “He was a student at the Basel art college, a brilliant painter. Unfortunately, he soon realized that he could make more money as a criminal. But I thought that he had stopped his illegal life several years ago.” “So what was he doing outside?” “That’s a good question! Everyone knows that the display doesn’t start until tomorrow.” “You think he’s preparing to steal it?” “Perhaps.” Spiegel was hurrying back toward Kreine’s office. “But I would be surprised. Normally Zaun isn’t so directly involved.” “This is no normal painting.” “True.” “Could Patrick Zaun be The Ghost?” “That’s impossible. He’s been hundreds of miles away from The Ghost’s crime scenes. But he might be working with The Ghost, or someone else. After all, The Ghost may not be the only person trying to steal the painting.” “Shouldn’t we try to find him, then, and talk to him?” “We will, but later. First we need to move the painting. If Zaun was watching the building for The Ghost or anyone else, he’s gone now. That means that this is the best time to get the van Gogh away from here! Remember, the best time to steal a painting is when it’s being moved from one place to another. We need to get The Yellow Field to the safety of the Kunstmuseum as soon as possible!” One hour later, Spiegel and Knapp were standing with Frau Estler, the curator of the Kunstmuseum, in one of the building’s many halls. The van Gogh was at last safely locked away in the secure basement directly below the museum. “I agree with you, Max,” said Frau Estler, “and Herr Kreine is happy to take my advice.” The curator was about the same age as Spiegel, but like him, she managed to look much younger. And like Miranda Knapp, her clothes were very stylish. “This is the best room for The Yellow Field, both for visitors and for security. It seems right, too, that the van Gogh should appear in our Dutch room.” She pointed to the wall beside her, a large space covered in old paintings. “And this is the obvious wall to hang it on. We will of course clear these other paintings. However, I’m afraid it’s very short notice, and all of our employees are busy with our current exhibition. I have asked for extra staff to come in to help, but they won’t arrive until later.” “Don’t worry, Frau Estler. Detective Knapp and I can get started on clearing the hall. We don’t want to waste any time.” “Of course.” Despite the difficulties of handling the auction with so little warning, Frau Estler was clearly delighted. Her museum was to be a part of the greatest art sale in many years and, with the agreement of the painting’s owners, Herr Kreine had offered to more than meet the museum’s costs. “You know the way, don’t you, Max?” she continued. “You can use the north elevator over there; we will of course close it to everyone else. The alarms have already been turned off, and there is plenty of equipment to help you move the paintings down to the basement. But please, move only one at a time.” “Of course, Frau Estler,” answered Knapp, giving her best smile. But it was a smile that disappeared as Frau Estler left the room. Spiegel noticed. “I know you disagree with this,” he told Knapp. “But Herr Kreine has made the right decision. The first rule of security is to remove the risk. This is the safest place for the van Gogh.” “But you want to catch The Ghost as much as I do!” “Of course I do. And maybe we still can. Do you really think The Ghost will give up just because we’ve moved the auction? The temptation will still remain. It may even increase with the challenge. This could all be to our advantage. Security here at the museum is tighter, and The Ghost will have far less time to plan. Don’t worry. We may yet catch The Ghost. Now let’s get started.” He handed a pair of special gloves to Knapp and, slowly and carefully, the two detectives began to clear the paintings from the museum wall. “I don’t understand the appeal of these older paintings,” said Knapp, as they worked. “I think it’s right that they’re making way for a van Gogh. If I was the curator here and managing the art collection, I wouldn’t bother with anything more than one hundred years old.” “And that is why you never will be curator here,” smiled Spiegel. He pointed around the room. “These are some of the greatest works of art ever created. There would be no modern art without these. The artists displayed in this room, Rubens, Vermeer, Rembrandt, and Brueghel, influenced almost everyone who followed them. Even Vincent van Gogh.” “But van Gogh was a great artist. He suffered for his art.” “Is suffering really necessary to make great art? But since you mention it, you see this?” Spiegel pointed to a painting still on the wall. It showed a girl pouring milk into a bowl. “That is by Vermeer. His paintings are now worth millions. Yet despite that, despite all his very great skill, he died in great debt.” Spiegel approached another, a small painting of an old man, and gently removed it from the wall. “This is by Rembrandt. It’s one of the paintings he made of himself just before he died. Rembrandt lost three of his children before they were even two months old. When at last he had a son who survived, it was Rembrandt’s wife who then died. Is that suffering enough?” “You seem to know a lot about the art in this room,” said Knapp. “I should. My specialty is Dutch art from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.” Knapp laughed. “Then I clearly chose the wrong person to discuss this with! But just remember that if you asked ten people on the street who their favorite painter is, I bet at least half of them would say it’s Vincent van Gogh. You can’t argue with such popularity.” “It’s true that van Gogh is at the top of the list for thieves and people with more money than taste. Does that make him a great artist?” Before Knapp could answer, there was a loud noise from in front of the museum. Security guards began shouting and running toward the building’s main door. “What is it?” called Knapp. “Who’s there?” Knapp’s expensive tastes The noise was getting louder and louder, with more and more people shouting. It sounded like a huge crowd was gathering outside. Knapp looked through the window to the front of the building, and Spiegel saw her immediately relax. “It looks like journalists,” she said. “Marc Bardieu is there.” “Kreine must have informed all of the newspapers,” said Spiegel. “They’ll want to know why the auction has been moved.” He carefully put down the Rembrandt painting he was holding. “Wait here. I’ll go and talk to them.” Spiegel began to walk toward the front hall, but then stopped. “Actually,” he said, turning back, “why don’t you speak to them? I’m sure Bardieu will be more agreeable with you, and I know that our boss would prefer you to be the face of SACO rather than me. Just don’t mention the knife that we found. Tell them only that we have moved the auction here because the crowd of visitors would be too big for the Kreine and Halske building. Understand?” With a nod, Knapp checked that her clothes looked tidy. Then she hurried happily toward the journalists. Behind her, Spiegel carefully continued to clear the paintings. Less than two hours later, the room was clear. The museum’s usual staff had joined them, and now all of the Kunstmuseum’s regular Dutch paintings were locked in the secure basement with The Yellow Field. Spiegel took five minutes to further instruct the staff on the preparations for the next day, then picked up his briefcase and looked at his watch. “Good!” he said. “Everything is ready here, and it’s only four o’clock. That gives us plenty of time to visit Patrick Zaun. I’d like to ask him a few questions.” “Do you know where he lives?” “Yes. He has an artist’s studio in the woods in the hills to the east of the city.” “Good. But let’s take my car. I’ve heard about yours.” Ten minutes later, Spiegel was standing in a Basel street and looking at a bright red sports car. Knapp smiled at the look on his face. “Climb in,” she said. “This must have cost you as much as I earn in three years!” “I bought it as a treat for myself. The insurance industry pays far better than SACO.” “You sound bitter,” remarked Spiegel. “Perhaps I am a little,” answered Knapp. She turned the car toward the edge of the city. “Aren’t you?” “Should I be?” “I know your story, Detective Max Spiegel. You’re the most successful art policeman ever. There’s nothing about art security that you don’t know. You’ve advised museums and private collectors in almost every major city in Europe, and you’ve caught some of the worst criminals in the art world. In over thirty years, you must have personally saved or recovered artwork worth hundreds of millions of francs. And what have you received in return? A salary that apparently forces you to work in the Kunstmuseum in your free time, to dress in clothes not even my grandfather would have worn, and to drive a car that must be at least twenty years old!” “There’s more to life than money, Miss Knapp. My reward is the satisfaction of knowing that I’ve done my job. I love art. I certainly don’t measure a painting by how much it costs.” “But everyone likes to feel valued. Don’t you feel you deserve even a little of the money that you’ve saved? I bet your wife does.” “I’m not married.” “No?” “There’s not a lot of room for family in our job, Miss Knapp. I’m afraid you might discover that for yourself. Or perhaps you already have, with Marc Bardieu.” “What do you mean?” “It’s obvious that you two have a history. Or are you still involved?” “Whatever happened between us was a long time ago, believe me. We moved in the same circles. We went to the same displays, the same auctions.” “He’s a good-looking man. Confident. Successful.” “Perhaps. But I soon discovered that he’s not my type.” Knapp stopped at some traffic lights. “So what about you? If you have no family, do you live alone?” It was clear that Knapp didn’t want to talk about Bardieu any more. “No,” Spiegel answered. “I don’t live alone.” He smiled. “I have a cat.” She laughed. “And does your cat appreciate art?” “Only when it’s at least one hundred years old.” Knapp laughed louder. They were now on the main road out of Basel. She was driving faster and faster. The speed was pushing Spiegel back into his seat. “I have to ask you the obvious question, Miss Knapp.” “Call me Miranda.” “All right, Miranda. If you think this job isn’t properly appreciated, why did you ever join SACO?” Knapp laughed. “That’s easy to answer,” she said. “Like you, I love art. But while we talked about it all the time in the insurer’s office, we almost never actually got to see it.” She put her foot to the floor and the noise of the engine grew. “Besides,” she shouted, “chasing criminals is far more exciting.” The art criminal “I see that SACO agents are getting prettier.” Patrick Zaun was one of the tallest men Knapp had ever seen. His head was nearly touching the frame of his studio door. Spiegel pointed to Knapp. “Patrick, this is Detective Knapp.” Zaun only nodded. “You’re wasting your time, Spiegel. I don’t know anything.” “We know you spent your morning outside the Kreine and Halske auction house. Why?” Zaun smiled. “That’s not illegal, is it?” “Do you mind if we come in?” Zaun clearly did mind. But although he didn’t open the door, he did step back into the house. Spiegel opened the door and he and Knapp followed. Inside, the studio was a mess. Every inch of wall space was covered by paintings, finished and unfinished. Many more were laid out on the floor, surrounded by painting equipment. Knapp recognized a lot of them. On one wall there were copies of paintings by Leonardo, Titian, and Raphael. On the opposite wall there were copies of works by Monet, Renoir, and Munch. And there were a lot of van Goghs. The studio looked like a museum that had been hit by a storm and was full to the ceiling with some of the most famous paintings ever created. “This place is amazing,” she said. “It is, isn’t it,” agreed Spiegel. “Why don’t you tell Detective Knapp how you make your money, Patrick?” Zaun sighed. “I’m an artist. That’s not a crime. I copy famous paintings because people like to have copies, and because there is no better way to learn how to paint well. That’s not illegal either.” “True,” agreed Spiegel. “In any art museum in the world you’ll see people learning to draw by copying the paintings. But they don’t then pretend that their copies are the originals!” “I make it very clear to my clients! They know the work I sell has been painted by me. It’s not my fault if they then claim differently when they sell them. You may as well arrest people who make guns! It’s the people who use them for the wrong purposes that are to blame.” “All right, Patrick. Let’s talk about this morning. What were you really doing at the Kreine and Halske building? Were you doing a little preparation for yourself? Or gathering information for someone else?” “I’m curious, that’s all! Apart from a few poor quality photos, The Yellow Field hasn’t been seen in sixty years! It’s a big occasion.” “The display doesn’t open until tomorrow. You know that.” “So?” “So why were you standing outside the building this morning?” “I was in town anyway. I was just passing.” “I don’t believe you.” “That’s not my problem.” “Shall I tell you why I don’t believe you? Because even if The Ghost steals The Yellow Field, he’ll still need help to sell it. Because no one knows who he is. That means that no one knows how to contif they want to buy it. So there must be someone else involved, someone acting as agent for the sale. Someone with contacts in the criminal art world. Someone interested in earning commission on a sale worth four million francs. And I think that person is you, Patrick.” Saying nothing, Zaun sat down at his table. Spiegel walked around and sat opposite him. The two men stared at each other in silence. Then the detective sighed, as though he was tired of the discussion. “You must know something,” he said. “Why?” “Because you’re connected to the art world like no one else. You’re almost famous in the art world, Patrick. You could find a richer buyer and a better price than anyone else. That’s why I think The Ghost must have contacted you.” Still Zaun said nothing. “The Ghost is the biggest art thief of the century. And this auction is the biggest art sale of the century. Don’t tell me you don’t want a part of that.” “I’m a legal businessman,” replied Zaun. “I don’t want anything to do with it.” “Of course you do, Patrick.” Spiegel moved closer. “You appreciate good art. And you know that this is good. It’s a van Gogh.” He said the name as though they were magic words. “Everyone wants it. The Dutch want it. There’s a long line of rich businessmen from America to Australia who want it. And I know that The Ghost wants it.” “I told you, I don’t know anything about The Ghost.” Spiegel ignored him and continued talking. “This sale isn’t just about art, Patrick. It’s about politics. If you’re going to get involved, you should understand that. If the painting is stolen, it won’t just be SACO coming after you. There will be the Dutch police. There will be the insurance company. And there will be others, too, from all over the world. And they might not all be as gentle as us. Understand?” Zaun stared at the top of his table. He was beginning to look very uncomfortable. “Look,” he began. It was clear that he didn’t want to say anything. “I did hear whispers about The Ghost.” “What whispers?” “The same ones you’ve heard. The same ones that have made you move the display to the Kunstmuseum: that he’s planning to steal The Yellow Field. But that’s honestly all I know.” “Any interesting orders recently?” “Nothing unusual.” “No new clients, then? No requests for a copy of The Yellow Field?” Zaun laughed. “Not even I can make a copy of a painting I’ve never seen. Anyway, you know I can’t tell you anything about a large number of my clients.” “Why not?” asked Knapp. Zaun looked up to face her. “Because often I never even meet them. I receive a lot of my orders by post, along with the money. I send the paintings back the same way.” “So you must at least have addresses for your clients,” said Knapp. Zaun shook his head. “I send them to the post office for collection. I told you, I don’t know anything. It’s better that way.” There was another silence. Spiegel and Knapp shared a glance. “We’d better get back,” she said. Spiegel turned back to Zaun. “Remember, Patrick, it’s difficult for a man of your height and your connections to hide. We’ll be looking for you. And if we find that you’ve got anything to do with The Ghost . . .” The detective let the warning hang in the air. Then, with a nod to Zaun, they walked out of the studio. The auction “Surely you don’t believe him, do you?” asked Knapp. “That Zaun was in town this morning just to admire the painting?” “Of course not. But there’s nothing we can do. We have no reason to arrest him.” As the two detectives drove back into town, the evening was growing dark. “His paintings are amazing,” said Knapp. “Zaun’s a real expert. He manages to make brand new works look hundreds of years old!” “That’s the problem,” answered Spiegel. “He’s too good at his job.” Knapp smiled. “I might ask him to paint something for me. I wouldn’t mind a van Gogh on my bedroom wall!” “But would you be happy, knowing that it’s not the original?” “Of course I’d prefer the real thing. But my last job didn’t pay that well!” “Let’s make sure that nothing goes wrong tomorrow, then,” answered Spiegel, without smiling. “Otherwise you might find you have no job at all.” “Only twenty minutes until the display closes and the auction begins,” said Frau Estler. “Congratulations, Herr Kreine! I would say that this has been a very great success.” It was almost six o’clock the following day. Spiegel, Knapp, Frau Estler, and Herr Kreine were standing on a special stage in the Kunstmuseum hall. From there, they could look down into the busy crowd. The van Gogh was hanging on the opposite wall, beautifully lit. For almost eight hours, Spiegel and Knapp had watched carefully as thousands of people pushed forward to see the famous painting. And they had watched as those people at last walked slowly back out of the building, thoughtful and clearly touched by the experience. Spiegel had examined every face. His focus had never left the crowd below. “It’s a truly amazing work, but I’ve never seen so much interest in a single painting,” admitted Frau Estler, looking down into the sea of people. “I can’t wait to see how the auction goes. I’ve no doubt that the family selling it will be very pleased. And I’ve already spoken to one or two of the journalists. I’m sure you’ll read some favorable articles in tomorrow’s newspapers. This will reflect very well on Kreine and Halske.” Kreine nodded, but he still didn’t smile. Spiegel wondered if his face was even able to smile. With the actual auction fast approaching, he was looking increasingly nervous. Spiegel looked around the hall once more. He had placed guards in every corner, and on both sides of the painting. All of the windows in the hall were locked, and all of the doors except for the ones at the entrance. In his hand he held a radio. He needed only to press a button and, at his signal, the guards at the doors would shut and lock them immediately. No one would then escape. Beside him, Knapp was looking tired. But she never stopped looking around the hall. She regularly walked down amongst the crowd, checking the windows and doors and making sure that the guards were ready for anything. “Nearly done,” she said, so that only Spiegel could hear her. “Well done! You may not have caught The Ghost, but at least you can retire knowing that the van Gogh is safe.” “We’re not finished yet,” answered Spiegel, his eyes still on the crowd. “I won’t relax until the painting is sold and taken away. Until then, it’s still our responsibility.” “Don’t worry,” she answered. “There’s no way that The Ghost . . .” “Look!” Spiegel stopped her. He pointed into the crowd. “It’s Zaun!” Knapp looked where he was pointing. Zaun was easy to see. Even though he stood in the middle of the crowd, he was far taller than anyone else. And while everyone else was moving straight toward the painting or back toward the doors, he seemed to be looking all around. “What’s he doing?” asked Knapp. “If he’s just here to see the painting, why isn’t he moving toward it?” “It looks as though he’s trying to get to the far corner of the hall.” “I’ll go and speak to him,” said Knapp, and she turned and ran down into the crowd. “Wait!” called Spiegel. “Our focus should be on the painting!” But Knapp was already gone. Beside him Frau Estler and Herr Kreine seemed frozen with fear. Spiegel stared down into the crowd. He could see Knapp getting closer to Zaun. The tall man saw her approaching and began shoving people like a guilty person trying to escape. That was enough for Spiegel to believe that something wasn’t right. He wasn’t going to take any chances. “Attention! Attention!” Spiegel shouted into his radio as he ran downstairs and began to push his way through the crowd toward the van Gogh. “Close the doors! We have a suspect in the hall. Don’t let anyone in or out!” The painting was less than twenty meters away. Spiegel pushed harder, shouting as he went. “Police! Let me through!” “Detective?” It was Bardieu, the reporter. He was standing in Spiegel’s way. “What is it?” “Move!” But Bardieu refused. He wanted to know what was happening. “Is something wrong?” he asked. Spiegel looked around the heads of the crowd. He couldn’t see Zaun or Knapp, but he heard her shouting from the far corner. He couldn’t understand what she was saying. From that same side of the hall, someone screamed. Spiegel pushed his way past Bardieu and was only ten meters away from the van Gogh painting. And then, suddenly, the lights went out and the whole room turned black. The Ghost’s success The following day, Spiegel drove back to his home in the hills above Basel. As he got closer to the old wooden house, he could see Miranda Knapp. She was standing against the side of her sports car, waiting for him. Spiegel stepped out of his car. With his old briefcase, and a shopping bag in his hand, he walked toward his door. “Ulrich told me where to find you,” said Knapp. “This is a beautiful place.” Spiegel stopped and looked around, as though he was seeing it for the first time. He looked down into the valley below. Beyond the city, the river turned slowly into the distance. Far away, the mountains shone in the sun, their tops covered with snow. “Yes,” he nodded. “It really is.” Knapp pointed to the briefcase with a smile. “I guess that old briefcase will be retiring now as well?” Spiegel laughed. “Perhaps you’re right. I’ve just taught my last class at the Kunstmuseum.” “How was Frau Estler?” “I think she has recovered. The hall has been returned to its normal state. All the old paintings are back on the wall.” “Good.” There was a silence. Spiegel could see that Knapp wanted to say something, but felt uncomfortable. Then she seemed to change her mind. “Have you read Bardieu’s article?” she asked instead. “No.” Knapp picked up a copy of the Bern Times newspaper from her car and began to read from the front page, “The art world was shocked yesterday by the sale of Vincent van Gogh’s The Yellow Field. In an auction lasting over half an hour, the sixty-year-old painting was finally sold for 5.2 million francs. This is a record for any artwork painted in the last three hundred years, and makes The Yellow Field the most expensive van Gogh painting ever sold. It was bought by a group of Dutch businessmen and private collectors. Together they intend to gift the painting to the Dutch people for public display in Amsterdam. ‘This is a wonderful day for our country,’ said the Dutch Queen. ‘The Yellow Field has come home.’” “A happy ending, then,” said Spiegel. “There’s more,” answered Knapp, and she continued to read. “There were reports before the sale that the art thief known as The Ghost was planning to target the painting. However, Detectives Max Spiegel and Miranda Knapp of Europe’s Serious Art Crime Office led the security arrangements, and their work was enough to frighten away the thief. There was, however, a worrying moment when the Kunstmuseum’s display hall lights broke. But SACO’s head office in Paris this morning insisted that this was only a technical fault and that there were never any concerns for the safety of the painting. After a career of more than thirty years, Detective Spiegel is now retiring with the respect of all the art world, both legal and criminal.” For a moment, Spiegel looked at the ground in silence, his face empty of expression. “I’m sorry, Max,” said Knapp, at last. “What for?” he asked, looking up. “For suggesting that your work isn’t appreciated. And I’m sorry for my attitude when we met. I thought I knew better than you. I didn’t believe in The Ghost.” Spiegel nodded kindly. “You did well.” “You mean we did well.” “And what about Zaun? Did he say why he turned off the lights?” Knapp laughed. “Yes. He told me he wanted to make a statement. He said that too many artworks disappear from public sight. Apparently they’re hidden away in private collections where they’re admired for their value and not appreciated for their quality.” Spiegel laughed. “Perhaps he has a point. But I don’t believe that’s really why Zaun was involved.” “Nor did I. So I questioned him a little more. Finally, he admitted that you were right. He was contacted by The Ghost. He says he received a letter a few weeks ago. Inside was about eight thousand francs and instructions to turn off the lights at a certain time, wherever the painting was to be displayed.” “That’s all? Nothing about using Zaun to sell it afterwards?” “Nothing. The Ghost must have had other plans.” “And don’t tell me: Zaun has burned the letter.” “Exactly. He says it was sent from Zürich, but that’s all we know. There’s nothing we can use to track The Ghost.” “Do you believe that Zaun’s told you everything he knows?” “I do. We have confirmation from the main post office that he keeps a post box there. And he’s shown us the money he received. When I told him we could arrest him for attempting to steal The Yellow Field, he told me everything he could.” “Where is he now?” “Ulrich decided to let him go. He’s more use to us out of prison. He knows we can arrest him whenever we want, so he’ll work with us in the future.” “And that knife we found? Were there any marks on it? Anything at all?” Knapp shook her head. “Not a thing.” “I suppose that would have been too easy. But The Ghost is too good to make a mistake like that.” “The Ghost might be good. But we beat him.” “Or her.” Knapp laughed. “Or her,” she nodded. She looked very happy. “We beat The Ghost.” “But we didn’t catch him.” “I’m only thirty-two,” answered Knapp. “I’ll catch him eventually.” There was a moment of silence, then she asked, “What about you? What will you do now?” “I’m going to enjoy my retirement.” Knapp looked around. Spiegel knew that his home and his shopping bag with food for one person must look very quiet, very boring, and very lonely for someone like her who enjoyed excitement. “I hope you do,” she said, and she turned back to her car. “I’ll be in touch.” Spiegel nodded and stood watching as she drove away down the hill. Then he unlocked his front door and walked inside his house. He threw his jacket onto a nearby chair and put the shopping bag down on the kitchen table. Then he walked with his briefcase toward his office at the back of the house. Pulling out a second set of keys from his pocket, he carefully unlocked all five locks on his office door, then stepped inside. The room was dark. The windows were shut and the blinds tightly closed. The walls were all lined with cupboards, all of them closed. Spiegel stepped toward a large desk and carefully placed the old briefcase on top. Then he began to open it. A sudden noise made him freeze and he looked up quickly toward the door. Then he relaxed as a black and white cat jumped up onto the desk beside him. “Go on,” he said, waving it away with a smile. “You’ll get all dusty. The dirt above that elevator was terrible.” The cat jumped back down and, with controlled excitement, Spiegel pulled some special white gloves from the desk. He then opened the case and removed a thin box wrapped in soft paper. From another pocket in the briefcase, he removed a knife similar to the one that had been found taped to the chair in the Kreine and Halske auction house. Very carefully, he cut the box open. Inside the box was a painting. Opening a cupboard door, Spiegel hung the painting on the wall inside. He then walked around the room, opening all of the cupboards. Finally, he poured himself a drink and settled back into a large and comfortable chair by the desk. “What do you think?” he asked the cat with a smile as it jumped up to sit on his knee. “You appreciate quality, don’t you? You don’t just like them because of their value, do you?” Spiegel sat surrounded by an impressive collection of famous artwork. Not one of them was less than two hundred years old. And in the middle of it all was the latest addition, the beautiful Rembrandt painting. It was the same one he had taken off the wall of the Kunstmuseum the day before and hidden above the elevator, exchanging it for a copy by Zaun that he’d placed there some days before. Detective Max Spiegel had at last retired with the admiration of all who knew him. And The Ghost had retired with one of the most valuable private art collections in the world.

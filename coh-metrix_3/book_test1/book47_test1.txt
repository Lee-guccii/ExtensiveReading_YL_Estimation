Introduction In our lives, we interother people. We interfamily members. We interfriends. We interclassmates and teachers at school. We intercolleagues, customers, and bosses at work. And, we interpeople we do not know. Sometimes, we may be unhappy. Sometimes, we may be having a bad day. Sometimes, we may be angry or upset about something. But, it is important to always treat other people with respect. It is important to be polite in what we say and what we do. Being polite helps our interactions with other people. Being polite helps us to develop relationships with other people. It helps us to make other people feel good. It helps them to think that we are good, too. If we are not polite, we may make other people feel angry. If we are rude, we may make other people feel sad or upset. These people may think that we are bad. Sometimes, they may not want to speak to us or to do anything with us again. Now, stop and think for a moment about your life. Are you always polite? Or, are you sometimes rude to other people? Do you want to be politer? Let’s look at ten ways that you can do this: 1. Say “please” and “thank you” We often ask people to do things for us. Maybe, we order food and drink in a coffee shop. We want the worker to pass us a sandwich and a coffee. Maybe, we want to borrow something from a friend. Maybe, we need some information. We want to know which train to catch at the train station. In order to be polite, we should always say “please” after our requests. For example, we might say, “Could I get a tuna sandwich and a café latte to go, please?” Saying please is an easy thing to do. And, it shows respect to the other person. It shows respect for the effort they will give you to complete your request. In the same way, when somebody does something for us, we should say “thank you.” We show the person respect by thanking them. We show that we appreciate the other person. We show that we appreciate the time and effort they gave to do something for us. Saying thank you is also an easy thing to do. It costs us nothing to say it. And, it makes the other person feel happy. So, to be polite, we should always remember to say “please” and “thank you.” Say these words to everybody who helps you, no matter how small. 2. Greet people When we see people that we know, it is important to greet them. We should greet friends and teachers at school. We should greet colleagues and bosses at work. We should say, “Hello,” “Good morning,” or “Good afternoon.” We should smile. And, we should ask them how they are. Greeting people is very polite. When we greet people, we show that we know them. We show that we see them. We show that we care about them. And, we show that they are important to us. A simple greeting makes the other person feel happy. It also makes you feel happy. And, it helps to keep a good relationship with that person. Now, imagine you are at work or school. Somebody you know walks past you. You say a happy, “Good morning” to them. But, that person does not reply. They do not look at you. They do not answer your greeting. They just keep on walking. How would you feel? Most people would feel sad or upset. They would think the other person was very rude. They may feel the other person does not respect them. And, they may think twice about greeting that person again. So, remember to always greet people when you see them. And, remember to always reply to other people’s greetings. 3. Ask permission to do things Imagine you’re on a plane. You have to sit for a long time. You don’t have much space. You try to relax. Suddenly, the person in front of you moves their seat back. They didn’t ask you for permission. They just moved their seat without asking. Now, you have much less space. How do you feel? You’re probably upset, right? You may think the person is rude. You may think they only care about themselves. Imagine you’re at school. You’re looking for your pen. But, your friend has it. They took it without asking. They didn’t ask you for permission. How do you feel? You’re probably angry, right? You think your friend is rude. Imagine you’re at work. You feel cold. So, you turn the heater up very high. You feel much better. But, you didn’t ask for permission. You did it without asking. Now, the office is too hot. Your colleagues are upset. “Who turned the heater up?” they ask. You say you did it. They are angry with you. They think you are rude. To be polite it is always important for people to ask permission to do things. Always ask if it is okay to do things that may affect other people. Then, you show that you care. You show that you respect the feelings of others around you. 4. Apologize From time to time, we may do something wrong. We may make mistakes. We may break a promise. We may forget something important. We may say the wrong thing to somebody. We may walk into somebody on the street and hit them by accident. We may be rude to people. When we do something wrong, it may affect the people around us. It can affect them in a bad way. They may be angry or upset because of what we did. So, when this happens, it is always important to apologize to people. Apologizing is very polite. It shows that you know you are wrong. It shows that you know you’ve made a mistake. It shows that you know you’ve upset the other person. It shows that you feel bad for what you did. It shows you will make an effort to put things right again. And, it shows you won’t repeat the same action. So, if you’re late for class, apologize to your teacher. Say you are sorry. Say that you won’t be late again. If you shout at your colleague and upset them, apologize. Say you were wrong. Try to put things right. And, if you hit somebody by accident, apologize to them. Say you are sorry. And, ask if they’re okay. 5. Use appropriate language When we interpeople, we need to think about the words we use. To be polite, we need to use language that is appropriate to the situation. We need to use language that is appropriate for the person we’re interacting with. Imagine you are at work. You’re taking the elevator. Your boss, Hana Tanaka walks in. You need to greet her. In this situation, a polite greeting would be, “Good morning, Ms. Tanaka.” “Good morning” is appropriate, because you are greeting your boss. Also, using the title “Ms.” and the family name, “Tanaka” shows politeness and respect. A rude greeting would be, “Hey, Hana!” “Hey” is too casual. You’re not speaking to your friend. And, it may be too casual to use your boss’s first name (unless she has said it’s okay to do so). Now, imagine you are writing an email to your teacher. You want to know your test score. So, you write: What’s my score? Once again, this is not appropriate. You’re making a request to your teacher. The language is too direct. Your teacher may think you are rude. To be polite, you need to be less direct: I am writing to ask if it would be possible for you to let me know my test score. Thank you very much for your help. This shows politeness and respect. 6. Be courteous When we are courteous, we are polite to people. We make sure our actions are polite. We treat everyone with respect. We always put other people first. We show that we always think about the people around us. We care about people even if we do not know them. Imagine you’re in a crowded elevator. The elevator stops. People start to get out. A courteous person would let everyone go before them. A courteous person would say, “After you,” to people. They would hold the door. They would be the last person to leave the elevator. Imagine you’re leaving a store. You open the door to go outside. A courteous person would check behind them. They would check if anybody else is leaving the store. Then, they would hold the door open for the next person. They would wait until the person has walked through the door. They would wait until the person has hold of the door. Then, they would let go. Imagine you’re sitting on a train. An old person gets on. There are no free seats. The old person has to stand. A courteous person would stand up. They would offer that person their seat. Remember, being courteous to other people is an important part of being polite. And, it costs nothing! 7. Think about personal space Personal space is the space between you and another person. If you stand too close to another person, it is not polite. They may feel very uncomfortable. If you stand too far away from another person, it is not polite. They may think you don’t want to speak to them. Personal space may be different in each country. However, it is a good idea to stand an arm’s length (about 1 meter) away from somebody you do not know well. It is also usual to leave a space between you and another person when sitting in a coffee shop, movie theater, or on the train. If there are many free seats and you sit next to somebody you do not know, they may feel uncomfortable. When sitting, be aware of the personal space of people around you. For example, if you are sitting on a crowded train, think about the people next to you. It’s very rude to spread your legs wide apart (Some men especially like to do this – it is called manspreading). The people sitting next to you will have less space. And, they will be upset with you. 8. Be in the moment Imagine you’re having dinner with your family. During the meal, you don’t really listen to what your family is saying. The television is on. From the kitchen table, you can see it. You don’t speak much. You don’t ask any questions. Instead, you watch the television. How does your family feel about you? They probably think you are rude. Imagine you go out with your friends. Your friends are talking to each other. They are talking to you. But every minute, you keep picking up your smartphone. You keep checking your messages. You even start to text back. You spend time replying to your messages. How do your friends feel about you? They’re probably upset, right? When spending time with people, it is important to be in the moment with them. It is polite to listen carefully to each person. Listen to what your family or friends are talking about. Rewhat they say with “Really,” “Wow,” “No way,” or “Sounds great.” Ask them questions to get more information about their stories. They will be happy that you are listening. And, they will want to talk more to you. So, next time you’re having dinner at home, switch off the television – be in the moment. Next time you go out with friends, switch off your smartphone – be in the moment. 9. Know the culture We may know about politeness in our own countries. But, when we travel to a different country, it can be easy to make mistakes. Then, people in that country may think we are rude. So, before we travel, we should study. We should learn about the culture of the country we will visit. Then, we will know how to be polite. For example, in Japan, it is rude to speak on the phone while travelling on the train. You should wait until you get off the train. Then, you can make a phone call. If you speak on the phone while on the train, people will think you are rude. In Indonesia, it is rude for somebody to give or receive things with their left hand. You should always use your right hand. If you pay money in a restaurant with your left hand, the waiter will think you are rude. In America, it is polite to give a tip. If a hotel worker carries your bags to your room, you need to tip them. This can be from $1-5 a bag. If you have a nice meal in a restaurant, you need to tip the waiter. This can be between 10-20% of the total cost of the meal. If you don’t tip people, they will think you are rude. 10. Treat others as you wish to be treated And finally, the easiest guide to politeness is to treat other people as we wish to be treated. When we interother people in our everyday lives, we should think. Think about what we say and the things we do. Think about how we feel when somebody is rude to us. Then, it is easy to remember to always be polite. For example, imagine you’re in an elevator. The doors open. Somebody is courteous. They let you get out first. You walk out of the elevator. But, you do not thank the person. Now, stop and think. If you were that courteous person, how would you feel? You may be upset that the person did not thank you. If so, then treat others as you wish to be treated. If you wish to be thanked for your actions, always remember to thank other people. Imagine you’re on a train. You put your bag on the seat next to you. The train is crowded. People are standing. But, you don’t move your bag. Now, stop and think. If you were standing, how would you feel? You may feel angry that somebody has their bag on a free seat. You may think that person is very rude. If so, then treat others as you wish to be treated. Apologize. Move your bag. And, let somebody sit down. Summary Now, you have read the book, stop and think again. Do you think these ten ways can help you to be politer? Can you always remember to say “please” and “thank you” to people? Will you always greet people that you know? Will you remember to ask permission when you want to do something that may affect another person? Can you use language that is appropriate to the situation you are in? Will you be courteous to other people? Are you able to think about appropriate personal space when interacting with people around you? When you’re with family and friends, can you be in the moment? Will you learn about the culture before travelling to a different country? And, most importantly, will you treat others as you wish to be treated? After all, being polite in our everyday lives is important. If we treat people with respect, they will probably treat us with respect. If we are kind to people, they will probably be kind to us. If we make people feel good, they will probably try to make us feel good. If we are polite, other people will probably be polite, too. In this way, politeness can spread. Let’s start making the world a politer place to live in from today.

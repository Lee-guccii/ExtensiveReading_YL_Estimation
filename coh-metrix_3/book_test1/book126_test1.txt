Introduction How do you get your news? Do you read a newspaper? Do you watch news programs on TV? Or do you check a news website? Who do you think is interested in the news? Is it mostly older people? Is it business people? In fact, we should all be interested in the news. The news can tell us about important events and changes that are happening in our world. Today, the news is easier than ever to read or watch any time we want to. We can check web pages and news programs on our smartphones. We can check them anytime and anywhere. This is usually for free. It is very easy for us to get our news. However, it has become more difficult to understand the news. People often talk about fake news – news that is full of lies. It is difficult to understand what is really true. Many news articles and programs often have both facts and opinions. So, it is difficult for us to understand the difference. As readers, we have to understand which newspapers and news programs we should trust. We need to know how to tell good news from bad. We need to make sure we are getting good facts in our news. We need to do our best to understand these facts. Now, stop and think about the news you have read or watched. Were there many facts, or just opinions? If you can learn the difference, you can understand which news stories are true. Here are ten ways to help you understand the news: 1. Check the writer When you read an article, look for the writer’s name. The name should be at the beginning of the article. If there is no name, you should not believe the article easily. Most newspaper companies include the writer’s name in every article. Find the writer’s name. Do you know that person? Has that writer written many articles with good facts? Does that writer work for a famous newspaper? If so, you can believe the article more easily. When you read the news, be careful. Sometimes, the writer is not a professional. Remember, it is easy for anyone to write an article on the Internet. Anyone can create a blog. Do not believe these kinds of articles without checking other professional news articles or programs. Sometimes, you will not find a name. However, you will see the letters “A.P.” This means the writer is a member of the Associated Press. Writers of the Associated Press are trusted professionals. 2. Don’t use social media for news Most of us use the Internet to read or watch the news. Internet news is easy to read on our smartphones or tablets. It is also usually free. So, it is very popular. However, the problem with Internet news is that it is easy to make. It is easy to write. And, it is easy to share. This happens most often on social media. Anyone can write an article. Anyone can upload a photograph with a message. Sometimes, these can look very professional. So, people can believe them easily. People believe them without checking the facts. They share the news story quickly. Then, many people on their social media can see it. These people share it. And, their friends share it, too. Suddenly, a simple photograph or story with no facts can become a big news story. Millions of people might see it. When you see a photograph or story online, you should check the facts. Make sure the story or picture is true before you share it on your social media. 3. Get used to reading headlines A headline is the title of a news article. It is usually at the top of the article. It is in bigger letters than the rest of the article. Headlines are usually written differently than regular English. They often use present tense for things that recently happened. Words like “is” or “was” are often left out. The word “and” often becomes just a comma. For example: “A boy made an intelligent robot” becomes “Boy Makes Intelligent Robot” “A woman was attacked by a robot” becomes “Woman Attacked by Robot” “Could there be a war? The robot army is growing.” becomes “War? Robot Army Grows” “Peace has returned! The humans and robots have agreed to end the war” becomes “Peace! Humans, Robots End War” With headlines, space is very limited. Also, headlines must get your attention very quickly. That is why they are made as short as possible. In fact, when people read newspapers, they often only look at the headlines. So, it is important that each headline contains the main point of the news article. If you can get used to reading headlines, you can read a lot of news very quickly. 4. Understand facts and opinions When you read or listen to the news, you must remember the difference between facts and opinions. A fhave proof that shows it is true. An opinion is just what someone believes. Real news should always be factual. Facts usually use numbers that the writer has checked and researched. This information should not change, even if another person researches it. Other people should find the same information if they research it. On the other hand, opinions can change depending on the person. Everyone has different ideas about the world. For example, some people believe that guns are necessary for safety. Others believe that guns make the world less safe. Everyone might believe something different to be true. For example, you may read a news article that says, “Our town needs more roads.” To decide if this is a fan opinion, you should ask, “Why?” If you can ask “why” about a sentence, then that sentence might be an opinion. Or, the article might say, “Workers in our town drive an average of two hours every day to get to work.” Is that something that can be checked? If other people research it, will they get the same result? If so, then that information is a fact. 5. Understand expert opinion One kind of opinion can be very useful in the news. Expert opinion comes from professionals. They are an expert on a certain topic. They are experts because they have worked on the topic for a long time. Maybe, they are a researcher with many years of experience. Maybe, they are a professor. Maybe, they work in that particular area. These experts have a lot of knowledge, so their opinions are important. We hope that these experts use their experience and knowledge of facts to decide their opinions. We often ask these people about the future. Will plastic be bad for our world? Should students read more books? Are video games good for us? We want to know their expert Understand the News opinion because it is based on facts. However, many people experts. Many people say we should listen to their opinion. But, are they really experts? How can we decide who is an expert? The most important thing to remember is this: Being famous is not the same as being an expert. Many people make the mistake of trusting famous people. Famous people in the media can have powerful opinions. But remember, they are not experts. They cannot give expert opinion. They are only regular people with regular opinions. 6. Understand basic statistics If an article uses numbers, then the article has facts, right? We can trust the article, right? Let’s see. How do you feel when you read this statistic? The number of deaths from working with robots has doubled since last year. Doubled? This sounds very dangerous, right? The writer says the number has doubled. That means the writer has counted the number of deaths for this year and last year. So, it must be a fact. You probably now think that working with robots is a very bad idea. However, it is possible that last year there was only one death. And, it doubled. So, this year there were only two deaths. That is only one more than last year. Now, does it sound as dangerous as before? By using the word “doubled,” the writer makes the information sound much worse. That word is not a lie. The number of deaths did, in fact, double. But, the way the writer uses the statistic makes the reader feel differently. Readers may feel much more afraid of robots. In this way, writers, newspaper companies, and news programs can use statistics to change your opinion about a topic. 7. Understand Bias Countries usually have two or more political parties. They often fight for power and control. Some news companies try to bias the news to help one party more than the other. This is one of the most difficult challenges in finding true news. Many people only read news from one or two sources. They start to think about the world in the way the news company or political party wants them to. They feel like they agree with the opinions of that news company or political party. So, they keep reading the same news. Their ideas become more and more biased. Instead of being biased, you should read news from several sources. Notice the difference in how the news is reported by different news companies. Two different sources might report on a story in completely different ways. They may not give the reader the whole truth about the story. How do you know if your news is biased? Check other news companies. Look carefully at the different ways they explain an event. Try to understand how and why the stories are very different. You can also check the Internet. There are many discussions about how biased each news company is. 8. Understand fake news Fake news is easy to see if you know how. You should always be careful about trusting the news that you read. First, fake news usually contains a lot of opinions and not many facts. Or, the “facts” do not have any proof or any sources. Sometimes, they use other news articles as the source of facts. But often, that source is really just another opinion. Fake news may also focus on people instead of facts. An article might talk about someone’s strange hair. The article might say that someone is too old, or too young. In this way, some writers try to make you stop trusting the person written about in the article. Always remember that the way someone looks does not matter. Another easy way to recognize fake news is when the writer generalizes about a group of people. Maybe someone in a red cap did something very bad. So, the reporter says that all people in red caps are bad people. That is a silly idea. But, this kind of generalization happens a lot in fake news all the time. Usually, the writer groups people together by religion, culture, home country, or the color of their skin. 9. Do your own research The news is supposed to help you learn about information and events quickly. However, the best way to learn about a topic is to do your own research. This is very important if you see a news article you don’t understand, don’t believe, or don’t agree with. You should check the sources that the news article uses. The news article might tell you the source of their facts. You should look at the source directly. You should check to see if the facts match what is said in the news article. Often, you will see a quote. This is a sentence that was said by a famous person. Do you think the quote is okay? Or, do you think it sounds unusual? Check the information by doing a search on the Internet. Put the quote in the search along with the person’s name. Usually, it is easy to find out whether the person really said the sentence or not. Sometimes, you will find that the source of the facts is not correct. Sometimes, you will find that the source the article used is actually just another article. Does that article use a source, as well? Check that source, too. If you can’t find a good source, then you should not trust the article. 10. Use easy English news sites News articles often have many difficult words. It is hard to understand the facts if the English is too difficult. So, many people may read news articles that are written in easy English. There are many newspapers and websites that make news that is written in easy English. You can find many of them by searching the Internet for phrases like “easy English news,” or “ESL news.” These websites often have the same news article in different levels. The levels may be from easy to difficult. The easier articles have the same information. However, the English is not as difficult to understand. This is because the writer chooses more common words to explain the same information just like this book! You should choose which level you want to read. By doing so, you can enjoy learning about the news. You can enjoy a reading challenge that is not too difficult. Also, you should read the same news article again and again. When you read an article the second time, choose a more difficult level. Because you have read the article already, the more difficult level will seem easier. This is a great way to use the news to study English. Summary Now, you have read the book. Stop and think again. Do you think these ten ways can help you to understand the news?
